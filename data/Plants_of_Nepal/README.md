## Plants of Nepal supplied by KK Shrestha

raw - folder has the data as supplied with WFO ID field added. Not all names are matched, but all names with data are.
working - as just those records with content data associated with them
out - seperated into files for the facet/snippet server. For snippet there is Ecology, vernacular and distribitution. For the facet server there is country level occurance native only.

All files are csv utf-8. Vernacular names are in Preeti so look corrupted. I converted them to unicode for the vernacular csv.
