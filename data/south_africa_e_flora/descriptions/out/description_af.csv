wfo-1000020398,"Morphology: Plants medium-sized, erect to leaning sideways, solitary, unbranched, up to 0.4-0.5 m tall when not in flower. Stem usually absent, erect to slightly leaning when present, lower down clothed in persistent, somewhat twisted, variously down-curved, dry leaves. Leaves 30-40 cm long, 6-8 cm wide at the base, broadly lanceolate, dull dark green to strongly dark reddish brown-infused, densely rosulate, erect to variously and haphazardly horizontally spreading, terminal 1/4 to 1/3 dry, twisted, somewhat recurved; both surfaces generally smooth or sometimes with scattered or lengthwise aligned low, scattered teeth, spotted, more so abaxially; spots oval in outline, arranged in longitudinal rows, creamy to white to pinkish-infused, sometimes with a dark brown centre; margins dark chocolate brown, armed with pungent, shiny, dark brown deltoid teeth; teeth 3-5 mm long, 9-18 mm apart, straight or very slightly curved towards leaf base. Inflorescence a panicle, usually four-branched, one produced per flowering season, 0.5-0.6 m tall, erect, branched from well below middle, branches erect, remaining so when flowers reach anthesis, central raceme the longest. Peduncle stout; with several large, scattered, sterile bracts above point of branching of panicle; bracts ±20-25 mm long, drying rapidly, dull greyish, deltoid to elongated-deltoid. Racemes acuminate, hardly cylindrical lower down, 40-80 cm long, ±8-9 cm wide where flowers are at anthesis, usually subdensely-flowered; buds erect to horizontally spreading just before anthesis, flowers horizontal to pendulous at anthesis. Floral bracts elongated-deltoid, strongly clasping the pedicel and base of flower, more elongated than sterile bracts. Flowers: pedicellate, pedicels 8-11 mm long, copiously nectariferous; perianth: buds dull reddish orange and green-tipped; open flowers uniformly yellow to apically light greenish-infused, ±25-30 mm long, ±5-6 mm across ovary, widening above ovary; slightly erect to horizontally spreading, ± straight, club-shaped-enlarged towards the mouth, the middle and apical 1/2 slightly clavate-cylindrical; tips of segments spreading to very slightly flared, outer segments free for 18-21 mm; stamens with filiform-flattened filaments, included and exserted part uniformly light yellow, well-exserted for up to 10 mm, orange, dark reddish brown to blackish once pollen shed; ovary 6-7 mm long, 3-4 mm in diameter, light green; style well-exserted, included and exserted parts uniformly light yellow; stigma small, hardly capitate, yellowish white. Fruit a tri-loculicidal capsule, 12-18 x 8 x 10 mm, light green, often malformed, banana-shaped. Seed not seen. Chromosome number: unknown.
Habitat: In this part of the province, which abuts the arid Groot Karoo in the west, the vegetation is sparse, with low-growing karoo shrubs, annual grasses, and small, shrubby trees constituting the vegetation. Summer-rainfall region.
Distribution: Its natural habitat is near Philippolis in the southern Free State.","Smith, GF; Figueiredo, E. 2019. Aloe ×gemmelliae (Asphodelaceae subfam.
