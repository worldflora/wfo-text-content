Solanum memphiticum is a widespread species with AOO of 320 km2 (EN) and EOO of 4,489,278 km2 (LC); considering the weedy nature of the species and the large EOO, we suggest a preliminary status of LC (Least Concern) for the species. Like other members of the group, it is a species of open, disturbed areas, but is less common than S. tarderemotum or S. villosum in eastern Africa.

Solanum umalilaense is known mostly from cultivation in the southern part of Tanzania; based on its range (EOO = 2,559 km2; EN) and the number of populations (AOO = 32 km2) it would be assigned a preliminary conservation status of EN (Endangered), but might be better considered DD (Data Deficient). It is protected by local people, and its range is poorly known.

wfo-0001028423,"Preliminary conservation status (IUCN 2016). Solanum hirtulum is a country-restricted endemic with AOO of 48 km2 (EN) and EOO of 49,487 km2 (LC). The species is known from a small number of records, and it could be that the lack of collections reflects small population sizes and/or local rarity. From the EOO measure it would be assessed as LC (Least Concern), but since it is a single-country endemic it merits some attention, and we assign the species as NT (Near Threatened). The high mountains where it grows are at threat from grazing and human disturbance, but S. hirtulum, like other members of this group is a species of open, disturbed areas. The Simien Mountains have protected status as both a World Heritage Site and as a National Park in Ethiopia.

wfo-0001027276,"Based on IUCN Red List Categories (IUCN 2011), Solanum cowiei is considered Data Deficient (DD). The species is relatively widespread, occurring over a geographic range of over 800 km, but it has been collected in fewer than 10 localities. The small number of collections, coupled with the fact that populations outside of Litchfield National Park were only confirmed within the last several years, suggest that the species is common in some localities but uncommon on the regional and global scales. The clonal nature of the species is worth considering, as populations of Solanum cowiei often appear to be large multi-stemmed genets connected by an underground network of stolons. Because the species is dioecious, individual genets cannot self-fertilize, leading to the potential for reproductively isolated clonal individuals. Further data are required before a certain conservation status can be determined. Key populations are protected in Litchfield, Limmen and Keep River National Parks and appear secure given current fire management regimes.
"
wfo-0001345395,"Based on IUCN Red List Categories (IUCN 2011), S. ossicruentum is considered Data Deficient (DD). While the species appears to be relatively widespread over a range of approximately 90,000 km2, its range is not comprehensively understood. A relatively small number of collections, coupled with the fact that populations often consist of multiple individuals, suggest that the species is common in some localities but uncommon on the regional and global scales. Further data are required before a certain conservation status can be determined. Like other dioecious species of clonal nature, “populations” of S. ossicruentum have the potential to represent large multi-stemmed genets connected by an underground network of stolons (e.g. Martine et al. 2013). Given that individual genets in dioecious taxa cannot self-fertilize, clonal individuals have particular potential to be reproductively isolated. Recent observations of a small unisexual population by CTM in the Carr Boyd Ranges (just north of Lake Argyle) found that numerous female flowers had bloomed and senesced, ostensibly for lack of nearby male individuals and/or effective pollinators, and preliminary results from a population genetics study (Cantley et al. in prep) show low levels of genetic diversity for the species in Mirima National Park – a surprising outcome given that dioecious taxa are obligate outcrossers."

In addition to its restricted distribution, threats posed by the ongoing agricultural and urban expansion in the region of the Serra da Canastra are high; in this area native Cerrado vegetation has already been replaced by agricultural monocultures (e.g., sugarcane, soybean and coffee) and pastures. The high frequency of non-natural fires in areas of native vegetation also poses a considerable risk. The presence of S. medusae in some areas of the Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra is encouraging, but not enough to eliminate important risks, such as the loss of genetic diversity."

Solanum longifilamentum, since its recognition at the species level, has been shown to have a much wider distribution than originally thought by Särkinen et al. (2015c). Many recent collections exist, indicating that populations are not in decline and, as are most members of the Morelloid clade, S. longifilamentum is a weedy plant of disturbed areas.

Although the large extent of occurrence would suggest S. hunzikeri is not of conservation concern, the limited number of localities (<10), the specialised habitat and the disjunct distribution suggest the species should be considered as under some threat. Solanum hunzikeri occurs in a very restricted habitat in which there are few officially protected areas. In these landscapes the main threat to the ecosystem is over-grazing; the introduction of alien forage species has severely altered the nature of the high elevation foggy grasslands and forest edges in which S. hunzikeri occurs. Some populations are found in currently protected areas such as the Parque Nacional Aconquija, but these areas are considered too small and isolated to provide long term conservation (Brown 1995). Knapp et al. (2020) assigned a preliminary threat status of Vulnerable (VU, B2a,b(iii)) for S. hunzikeri.

Although the large extent of occurrence (> 20,000 km2) places S. amorimii out of the vulnerable category, the small number of locations (5-10) and the fragmentation of its forest habitat mean it is of some conservation concern. Populations occur within several private protected areas (in Minas Gerais the only population is within a private reserve) so the species is afforded some protection. On the other hand, the known collections suggest the species is restricted to pristine sites, which are becoming increasingly rare. As with all Geminata species, it is possible that more populations remain to be collected; these plants are inconspicuous in the deep forest understory and usually occur in small, sparsely distributed populations.

The record of S. conocarpum from Puerto Rico cited in the 1997 IUCN Red List (Walter & Gillett, 1998, based on a record in The Nature Conservancy’s 1996 National Heritage Database, not available on-line) is likely to be an error: I have seen no authentic material of S. conocarpum from Puerto Rico.

The sole locality in which S. coalitum has been encountered is the páramo of Cerro Toledo in the extreme southwestern corner of Parque Nacional Podocarpus, one of the largest protected areas in Ecuador. Cerro Toledo is a mixed páramo of tussock grasses and shrubby vegetation on the divide of the Cordillera de Sabanillas; the area is a pathway used by local people to take cattle from one drainage to another, and as such has a medium level of disturbance (Hofstede et al., 2002). Roads constructed by the military to allow access to radio towers have opened the area to others. Hofstede et al. (2002) suggest that the inhospitable nature of the climate in the region (wet, cold and windy) will limit human incursion on a large scale. Cerro Toledo is isolated from other páramo regions of southern Ecuador, and represents one of the southernmost extensions of the páramo habitat in the Andes (Luteyn, 1999). The fact that Solanum coalitum occurs only within the boundaries of the Parque Nacional Podocarpus is good news for its ultimate protection and conservation, but its very restricted distribution in an isolated habitat means it certainly is of some conservation concern.

Despite exploring several sites along the Mataquito River from spring 2021 to summer 2022, only twelve individuals were recorded, all in the vicinity of the Paula Bridge. The Area of Occupancy is 4 km² (grid resolution 2 km), and the Extent of Occurrence is 0.566 km². All plants exhibited signs of herbivory, and we observed cattle and horses left by locals in the river. Major threats include inappropriate use of the riverside, habitat change and fragmentation, cattle grazing, and the introduction of invasive species. Locals reported modifications to the riverbank over the past decade due to the recent invasion of Acacia
