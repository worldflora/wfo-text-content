wfo-0001027276,"Known from a handful of localities in the sub-arid tropical zone of the Northern Territory (a region known colloquially as the Top End), most of these habitats are classified under the Tropical eucalypt woodlands/grasslands Major Vegetation Group (National Land and Water Resources 2002). The species is associated with low sandstone outcrops and open eucalypt woodlands, where it typically grows among small boulders or in sandy grassy areas between or around rock formations. The areas where Solanum cowiei has been collected are fire-prone and burn at semi-regular intervals, allowing for this taxon to compete effectively with species of lesser fire tolerance.
"
wfo-0001345395,"Solanum ossicruentum is presently known from a wide range of localities in the sub-arid tropical zone of the Northern Territory and eastern Kimberley in Western Australia, including the northern edge of the Tanami Desert, mostly within the Victoria Bonaparte Terrestrial Bioregion (Australian Government 2012). The species associates closely with red sandstone, quartzite sandstone, and conglomerates (as per Tyler 1996), where it is found on hills, ridges, outcrops, and plateaus, growing in gravel or from fissures in pavement and dissected rock. It has also been collected frequently in steep gorges and washes, as well as at the base of rock formations in sandy levees and alluvial deposits. Among the associated taxa noted on herbarium labels are species of Triodia (Poaceae), Acacia (Fabaceae), Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), and Grevillea (Proteaceae). Although little is known about its relation with fire (one fruiting collection by Latz is from a recently burned habitat), the species is likely fire tolerant to some degree. Pollination biology of the species is unknown, but, like other Australian congeners, the flowers are likely buzz pollinated by bees in the genera Xylocopa and Amegilla (see Anderson and Symon 1988, Switzer et al. 2015). A small set (n=8) of ex situ hand pollinations conducted for this study showed that inaperturate pollen produced by functional females does not lead to fruit set when used to pollinate other females – suggesting that, like other dioecious solanums, reproduction in this species is dependent on intersexual outcrossing via biotic pollination. SEM images of the pollen confirm that morphologically hermaphrodite flowers produce inaperturate grains incapable of germination."

There are only sporadic collections from Asia since the type of S. khasianum was collected in 1847-1851. It is significant that when Sen Gupta published S. khasianum var. chatterjeeanum (= S. viarum) in 1971, he already had more collections of his new variety than of S. khasianum var. khasianum (=S. aculeatissimum). He had access to the larger Indian herbaria, but all seven collections of var. khasianum were from Assam State and all were collected in the period of 1850-1900. Solanum viarum is almost certainly a very recent introduction to Asia, perhaps mostly during the Second World War (Babu, 1971), although there is a collection from West Bengal dated 1932 (Parker 3195). While this latter species is fast becoming a common and widespread weed,it is possible that S. aculeatissimum was introduced during the early colonial period from Africa and has not been able to successfully establish itself.

Throughout its now extensive range (Nee, 1979) an often abundant weed in unshaded disturbed artificial weedy habitats such as roadsides, waste places, pastures, old coffee plantations, stream banks, beaches, cultivations (presumably the edges), open woods and around dwellings. Probably preferring sandy habitats but also recording from wet alluvial clay and limestone derived soils. Native along the Atlantic coast of Brazil; introduced in the Guianas, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras, common on the Caribbean islands, common in Florida, sporadic in nearby states; sporadically introduced in Hawaii, Africa, India and Sri Lanka, more commonly in southern China, Java, Sumatra, and Australia. It can be expected in to eventually occur as a cultivated plant or as naturalized in any tropical or subtropical area of the world. At elevations up to 1500 m, the great majority of collections from below 1000 m with no geographic trends apparent.
Sporadically introduced and perhaps naturalized in western Africa (Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Principe, and Ghana) and a few collections recorded from East Africa (Ethiopia and Tanzania); native to the Atlantic coast of southern South America (Nee 1979), but now widespread as an introduction, often an abundant weed in unshaded disturbed habitats and around dwellings.

Frequent in thickets of secondary-growth vegetation, along roadsides and fields and in other disturbed habitats, as well as in forest openings and along riverbanks. Solanum erianthum is native to North and Central America and is apparently rare in northern South America. It is adventive in India, China, the East Indies, and Australia. It was possibly introduced to the Philippines and thence to China, and elsewhere during the Spanish Galleon trade from Mexico, which commenced in the 16th century. Solanum erianthum occurs in many vegetation zones, from humid lowland evergreen tropics near sea level to dry Acacia-cactus thorn-scrub and, at higher altitudes (to 2000 m) in Pinus-Quercus forests. It is most common, however, below 1000 m. Individual scattered plants are most commonly seen but large thickets also occur where conditions are favorable.

wfo-0001026883,"The native distribution of S. carolinense var. carolinense prior to European settlement in North America is not known with much precision at a local scale because of its weediness and ability to disperse and colonize areas. Based on the location data of ca. 500 herbarium specimens examined, the native distribution extends from central Florida north to New York and Massachusetts and west to Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska to about the 97th meridian west. The species reaches Canada only in the southernmost areas of Ontario and Quebec Provinces (Bassett and Munro 1986; Cayouette 1972), and except for a single unverified report of the species in Mexico from the states of Sonora, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo Leon (Eberwein and Litscher 2007), we have not seen any additional evidence suggesting it occurred there as part of its native range. Recent floristic treatments and online databases record occasional occurrences in the western United States (Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California) where some states have classified the species as a noxious weed (e.g., Arizona, California, and Nevada [USDA 2014]). The species has been introduced in many areas around the world and has been reported from Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Croatia, England, France, Georgian Republic, Germany, Haiti, India, Italy, Japan, Moldova, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Turkey, and Ukraine (Cayouette 1972; Trapaidze 1972; D'Arcy 1974; Gazi-Baskova and Segulja 1978; Izhevskii et al. 1981; Bassett and Munro 1986; Ouren 1987; Webb et al. 1988; Park et al. 2001; Merluzzi et al. 2003; Li et al. 2006; Imaizumi et al. 2006; Eberwein and Litscher 2007; Dirkse et al. 2007; Viggiani 2008; Yasuyuki et al. 2010; Follak and Strauss 2010; Chinnusamy et al. 2011; Klingenhagen et al. 2012; Canadensys 2014). New introductions to temperate and subtropical regions around the world are expected to continue as long as agricultural crops are exported abroad from the eastern and southeastern United States. Solanum carolinense var. carolinense grows in a wide variety of conditions, from dry, well drained soils to seasonally inundated swales, fields, and river banks, from deep shade to full sun, and in sands, clays, loams, gravels, serpentine and calcareous outcrops, and the margins of coal mine and dredge spoils. It grows in various plant communities including prairies, deciduous woodlands, swamps, and pine forests, and in disturbed areas such as roadsides, grazed and mowed pastures, ditches, cultivations, urban waste areas, and utility and railroad rights of way.
