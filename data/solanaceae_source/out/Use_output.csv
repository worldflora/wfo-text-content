wfo-0001019990,"Capsicum annuum var. annuum is the economically most important member of the genus. The fruits are widely used in international cuisine in a broad spectrum of meals and preparations, because of their aroma, flavour, texture and level of pungency. Some cultivars have good acceptance as ornamental plants due to the colour of the leaves and the brightness of the colourful and usually erect fruits (e.g. Christmas peppers, Bolivian rainbow). There are few instances where medicinal uses have been recorded on herbarium labels, but the medical and nutritional importance, as well as the pharmacological properties and therapeutic effects of the active compounds, of C. annuum fruits have been extensively highlighted."

Solanum chenopodioides is considered to be toxic for cattle due to the high solanidine content of unripe fruits (Marzocca 1994), but as fruits ripen the alkaloid content decreases and fruits are apparently eaten without effect (Gallo 1987). In Argentina, fruits of S. chenopodioides are eaten by children of the Araucarian peoples (Martínez Crovetto 1968) and the Vilela people use them as a purple dye (Martínez Crovetto 1965)."

Although the authors suggest that the fruits (called “kara” in Walmajarri) are consumed by kangaroos, some Walmajarri people also “eat the outside part… but not the inside part” due to the “saltiness or unpleasantness of the fruit.” While the unripened fruits of S. ossicruentum are fleshy and “salty” tasting (C.

In addition to medicinal properties indicated in Table 3, C. chinense has spiritual uses which have sometimes been recorded by researchers on herbarium specimen labels.

In Peru (Comunidad Palcazú, Huamán et al. 317), the smoke of a single dried fruit is used to help children when they are tearful. In Brazil (Roraima; Comunidad Macuxi, Barbosa et al. 2002), the common name of the species is an allusion to ‘curupira’, a supernatural being, guardian of the Amazon forests in Tupi mythology (Gomez Platero and Palma Ehrichs 2011).

wfo-0001032453,"Cultivated for its edible fruits and leaves; Use of S. viride during cannibal feasts in Fiji has lead to a general macabre fascination with the species, and provided it with the English common name Cannibal's Tomato. Several authors wrote about the use of S. viride. The most extensive reports were provided by Seemann (1862, 1865-73) and Brewster (1922). According to Seemann (1862, 1865-73), the Fijians believed human flesh or boloka as they called it was difficult to digest and could cause constipation lasting two to three days or result in death. Apparently to aid in digestion, the leaves of three species, Trophis anthropophagorum Seem. (Moraceae), Omalanthus [sic Homalanthus] pedicellatus Benth. (Euphorbiaceae), and S. viride, were always eaten as a condiment being wrapped around the flesh before cooking (Seemann, 1862, 1865-73). The Fijians name for S. viride was boro dina (Seemann, 1862, 1865-73), sometimes spelled mboro ndina (Brewster, 1922); it is translated as true spinach (Brewster, 1922). To insure a regular and fresh supply, Solanum viride was grown next to the Bure-ni-sa or stranger's house where the bodies were brought prior to consumption (Seemann, 1862, 1865-73). The fruits of S. viride are described as having a faint aromatic smell (Brewster, 1922; Seemann, 1862, 1865-73) and were occasionally made into a tomato sauce. The last documented act of cannibalism in which S. viride was used occurred in July 1867 when the Reverend Thomas Baker, a British missionary, was eaten (Brewster, 1922). However, there is no reason to believe that S. viride was not used in subsequent cannibal activities extending through 1874. In Fiji, Solanum viride was also utilized by white settlers (Brewster, 1922; Seemann, 1862, 1865-73) presumably with a different main course."

In Puno (label data from Mullins 7), the bright red berries are used as a dye. Ruiz & Pavón record the use of poultices of the leaves to open wounds and draw out splinters (‘espinas’) and infections (a suppurating agent). In Bolivia, the boiled berries are used as an insecticidal wash against ticks and fleas for both humans and domestic animals (label data from Alvárez 84) and are also used in the treatment of a variety of contagious skin diseases. Crushed leaves are also used as a compress for skin conditions. Most of these uses and treatments depend upon the extreme bitterness of the berries, the bitter taste is probably due to their high alkaloid content. "
