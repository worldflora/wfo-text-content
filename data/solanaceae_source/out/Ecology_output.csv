wfo-0001027276,"Most flowering specimens have been collected from October-November and March-May, with fruiting specimens collected in Jan-Feb and May. Blooming appears to occur on new shoots soon after burns, as evidenced by dozens of male plants found to be in bud within weeks of managed burns set in the Lost City area of Litchfield National Park in late May, 2013. While the specific pollination biology is unknown, the flowers are clearly buzz pollinated and are likely visited by bees in the genera Xylocopa and Amegilla, among others (Anderson and Symon 1988). Seed dispersal seems, by initial impressions, to be mechanical. Fruits appear to detach upon maturation, leaving the calyces behind on the plant."
wfo-0001345395,"Most flowering specimens have been collected from February-July, with fruiting specimens collected in March-September. Seeds germinated for this study were from diaspores collected at the base of plants bearing flowers and immature fruits at Mirima National Park on 1 May 2014. These were assumed to have developed in the previous growth season. Seed dispersal appears to follow the relatively uncommon “trample burr” pattern for Solanum described by Symon (1979), whereby lightweight fruits enclosed in spiny calyces are carried in the fur of mammals. The fruits of S. ossicruentum detach enclosed within a long-spiny calyx at maturity, the diaspores gathering in piles on the ground or getting caught in tufts of hummock-forming spinifex grass (Triodia spp.) growing below parent plants. In the course of this study, only seeds from mature, bony fruits – the condition they are in when dropped from the plant - proved to be germinable."
