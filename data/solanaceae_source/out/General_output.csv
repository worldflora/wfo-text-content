wfo-0001028905,"Solanum lacinatum and S. aviculare are the two commonly cultivated species of the Archaesolanum clade; both have been used in the alkaloid industry (see Symon, 1994 for a summary) in the ex-Soviet Union, Australia and New Zealand. The two taxa are difficult to distinguish from herbarium specimens without notes on mature fruit colour; Baylis (1954) clarified their differences. Solanum aviculare is diploid, with orange or red mature fruit, and about 600 seeds per fruit; S. laciniatum is tetraploid, with green mature, and ca. 200 seeds per fruit. Solanum laciniatum may be a hybrid involving S. aviculare and/or S. vescum (Symon, 1981), but these ideas have not been tested using molecular methods. Crosses between Solanum laciniatum have been made with the diploid species S. aviculare, S. simile, S. linearifolium and S. vescum and the tetraploid species S. symonii (summarized in Symon, 1994)."
wfo-0001026849,"Solanum capsiciforme is a distinctive species in its small, linear leaves and fruits with very little flesh. It shares similar habit, linear leaves and green fruits with S. symonii and S. simile. Crosses between S. capsiciforme and other members of the Archaesolanum clade have not yet been attempted (Symon, 1994). Symon (1981) has suggested that S. capsiciforme is spreading E towards South Australia along roadsides and disturbed areas. The type locality, Lake Gillies, is west of Iron Baron, Eyre Peninsula, South Australia."
wfo-0001029151,"According to Symon (1981), variation in plant and leaf size in Solanum lucani due to difference in vigor may be substantial. In addition, specimens collected from rocky outcrops away from stream beds tend to have smaller and narrower leaves. Solanum lucani is similar and probably related to S. echinatum, from which it differs in its larger discolorous leaves, more abundant flowers and fruits, and in its ecology. From S. seitheae, to which it is less closely related, it differs in leaf and fruit characters; with smaller leaves and fruits that are not bony. The collector of the type specimens was August Lucanus, so the epithet is not correctable to “lucanii”. This species is related to S. echinatum, but differs by the sparsely prickly branchlets with 3-80 prickles per dm (vs. 200-660 for S. echinatum); branchlet prickles 6-10 times longer than wide (10-20 times for S. echinatum); the dense stellate hairs on the branchlets (vs. very dense for S. echinatum); the very long petioles, 65-115% of lamina length (vs. 25-55% for S. echinatum); and the deltate calyx lobes 1-2.5 mm long (vs. rostrate to attenuate, 3-6 mm long for S. echinatum). Etymology: From the Latin longissimus meaning ‘longest’, in reference to the exceptionally long petioles of this species, sometimes exceeding the lamina in length."
wfo-0001429778,"A species related to S. bahianum Knapp, from which differs by having bifoliate and geminate sympodial units, cuspidate calyx lobes, glabrous young stems and leaves, and pedicels with a constriction at the distal end that becomes swollen in fruit."
wfo-0001029091,"Poor specimens of Solanum linearifolium can be confused with narrow-leaved specimens of S. vescum, but the extremely well-developed sinus tissue (often exceeding the petal apices) in flowers of S. linearifolium is diagnostic. The brownish speckled fruits of S. linearifolium might be intermediate between the red-fruited and green-fruited members of the Archaeosolanum clade. Crosses have been made between Solanum linearifolium and the diploid species S. aviculare and S. simile and the tetraploid species S. laciniatum and S. symonii. I.I. Gerasimenko invalidly published the name Solanum linearifolium in 1965, without citing a specific type specimen, a requirement of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature after 1958 (Article 37.1; Greuter et al., 2000). Plant material cited was grown in Moscow from seed collected in an unspecified locality near Canberra, but no specimens nor herbaria were cited. Symon (1981) validly published the name with a holotype specimen he considered to be likely to have been from the same region as Gerasimenko’s material. Lake George is a well-known locality for this species and it is likely that the original seed grown by Gerasimenko came from this site (Gerasimenko, 1965). Additional specimens grown from seeds gathered from the type collection are at ADW and NSW, but are not isotype material."
wfo-0001030385,"Solanum physalidicalyx had long been recognised as a synonym of S. tweedieanum, a morphologically similar glandular-pubescent species, but Knapp et al. (2020) recognised it as distinct and unravelled the complex set of names surrounding these two species. Solanum physalidicalyx differs from S. tweedieanum in its conspicuously inflated calyx in fruit (as opposed to merely accrescent and tightly investing the berry) and in its anthers 3–3.5 mm long (versus 4–5 mm in S. tweedieanum, although some overlap can occur). The two species are partly sympatric in Argentina and in the absence of mature fruit, can be very difficult to distinguish, although in general plants of S. physalidicalyx are more herbaceous and delicate (usually annuals?) than those of S. tweedieanum, which are woody and rhizomatous."
wfo-0001031052,"Solanum sarrachoides is morphologically similar to S. nitidibaccatum. The two taxa can be distinguished based on generally truncate leaf bases, leaf-opposed inflorescences that are umbellate to sub-umbellate with fewer flowers (2-5, rarely 6-7), shorter calyx lobes 1.5-2.0 mm long, and a corolla with yellow-green central eye in S. sarrachoides, compared to S. nitidibaccatum which has attenuate to cuneate leaf bases, internodal inflorescences that are racemose with more flowers (4-8, occasionally up to 9-10), longer calyx lobes 1.7-2.5 mm long, and a corolla with yellow-green central eye with black-purple V- or U-shaped margins. The buds of S. sarrachoides are included in the calyx until just before anthesis and the berries are usually matte instead of shiny as they are in S. nitidibaccatum. Solanum sarrachoides is a diploid species native to north-eastern and central Argentina, Paraguay and southernmost Brazil. The introduction of the species to Europe and North America is largely due to trade with South America and the importation of seeds and grain together with the practice of spreading wool waste ('shoddy') as manure, and based on herbarium records seems to have been introduced some time at the beginning of the 20th century. Despite its introduction in the early 1900s, the species remains relatively uncommon in both Europe and North America, with sporadic records from elsewhere, including South Africa (e.g., Eastern Cape). Within the Eastern Hemisphere, S. sarrachoides has often been confused with S. nitidibaccatum and records of S. sarrachoides or S. nitidibaccatum in the literature should be taken with caution due to common misidentification of voucher material. Many regional treatments do not separate between these morphologically very similar species.
"
wfo-0001026782,"Solanum campechiense can be distinguished from other New World spiny Solanum species by its small stature, abundant straight prickles, and deeply lobed leaves with serrate margins. The fruits apparently turn purplish when ripe. In Chiapas, the label of López & Hernández s.n. (MEXU) says that “Se comen la fruta los peces cuando sube el nivel de agua”. The seeds differ from the usual yellow and slightly foveolate; the surface cells seem inflated and probably serve for flotation of a species often found on mud flats or edges of drying ponds. Specimens have been seen which begin flowering when the plants are only 2 cm tall. Plants of S. campechiense from Costa Rica may have flowers with smaller anthers than specimens from Mexico and Guatemala, based on the measurements in Nee (1993) and Gentry and Standley (1974), but this remains to be documented by examining herbarium specimens from these areas. "
wfo-0001030987,"Solanum salamancae is a distinctive species with winged or strongly spinescent stems, lacking glandular pubescence and with accrescent, inflated calyces with invaginate bases that completely enclose the berry. Other taxa with similarly accrescent calyces (S. hunzikeri, S. nitidibaccatum, S. physalidicalyx, S. sarrachoides, S. tweedieanum) are densely viscid-glandular pubescent. The strongly inflated calyces of S. salamancae are most similar to those of S. physalidicalyx; accrescent calyces of these similar species only partially cover the berry or are tightly appressed to it (e.g., S. tweedieanum)."
wfo-0001019990,"The domesticated taxon C. annuum var. annuum belongs to the Annuum clade, together with C. chinense, C. frutescens and C. galapagoense. The three domesticated species and their conspecific wild populations constitute the Capsicum annuum primary gene pool. The vast majority of the modern landraces, varietals and hybrids of chili peppers belong to this variety and it is consequently the most intensively studied species of Capsicum with regard to diversity, domestication and genetics. Conversely, a full comprehension of its taxonomy has not been achieved in the last 50 years. Research indicates that its domestication could have been initiated in central-east Mexico over 6,500 years ago. Due to the selective pressure for domestication and diversification, defining a characteristic group of traits for var. annuum is difficult; however, the most distinctive features are its herbaceous to shrubby, annual or perennial habit, the solitary axillary flowers (rarely two or more), the strongly 5–10-nerved calyx, the large white (or purple) corollas (up to nearly 22 mm in diameter) and the usually persistent and pendent fruits, which are highly variable in size, form, colour and pungency. Some of these traits contrast with those of var. glabriusculum which has a shrubby habit, 5-nerved calyx, smaller corollas (? 12 mm in diameter) and small (< 10 mm in diameter), globose, ellipsoid or ovoid, erect, red or red-orange, deciduous fruits."
wfo-0001030389,"Solanum physalifolium is one of several glandular-pubescent morelloids from the southern Andes. Morphologically it is similar to both S. physalidicalyx and S. profusum; the three species all have anthers 2–3 mm long and long, sticky glandular trichomes. Solanum physalifolium differs from S. physalidicalyx in mature fruits; the calyx is inflated and completely covering the whitish green to cream berry in S. physalidicalyx and only partially covering the dark green marbled berry in S. physalifolium. Solanum physalifolium is an annual, while S. profusum is a rhizomatous perennial. Leaf shape also differs; S. profusum has more lanceolate to lance-elliptic leaves, while those of S. physalifolium and S. physalidicalyx are ovate to elliptic ovate. The distributions of the three species do not overlap."
wfo-0001026988,"Solanum chenopodioides is a weedy, ruderal species occurring in open disturbed areas throughout its range. In South America, it is morphologically most similar to S. pilcomayense, with which it is sympatric in Argentina, but differs in its elliptic leaves with acute to attenuate bases (versus triangular leaves with truncate to hastate bases), smaller anthers (2–2.8 mm long versus 3–4 mm long), and deltate or triangular versus spathulate calyx lobes. The fruiting peduncle of S. chenopodioides bends downwards at the base so it is held at an angle of ca. 45-degree with respect to the stem (see Figs 35G, 36D), but this character is not always obvious in herbarium specimens. Anthers in S. chenopodioides are always much longer (2–2.8 mm) than in S. americanum (0.8–1.5 mm), and the berries are matte (versus shiny) in texture and always lack stone cells (versus often with 2–4 stone cells per berry in S. americanum). In the Eastern Hemisphere, it can be distinguished from all other Morelloids based on its narrowly lanceolate leaves with grey indumentum, inflorescences with ca. 3-7 flowers tightly congested near the tip of the peduncle, the stellate corollas that are deeply lobed to the base and usually with a dark purple or black central star and anthers that are usually more than 2 mm and up to 2.8 mm long. In fruit, the pedicels and proximal portion of the peduncle are strongly reflexed and the berries are not at all shiny. Solanum retroflexum has similar matte black berries, but has rhomboid leaves, less deeply divided corollas, shorter anthers and the calyx lobes are strongly reflexed in fruit. Solanum chenopodioides could also potentially be confused with the more common S. nigrum, especially in Europe, but differs from that species in its terete stems, matte black fruits on short strongly reflexed pedicels, and its smaller seeds (1.2 mm long versus 2 mm long). Solanum chenopodioides has a scattered distribution in the Eastern Hemisphere, but it seems to be spreading, perhaps related to climate change and/or increased habitat alteration. In southern United States, S. chenopodioides can be confused with S. pseudogracile and some populations of S. americanum around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Solanum chenopodioides can be distinguished from thes two species based on its short-triangular calyx lobes with acute apices that remain appressed to the berry at fruit maturity, as opposed to the longer, rectangular calyx lobes with rounded to acute apices that are reflexed in fruit of S. pseudogracile, are characters that distinguish the taxa. In flower, the extension of style beyond the anther cone is a good character to separate S. chenopodioides from S. pseudogracile; the style remains almost completely inside the anther cone in S. chenopodioides (exserted to 1–1.5 mm) and is clearly exserted in S. pseudogracile (exserted to (1)2.0–2.5 mm). Many specimens annotated as S. chenopodioides from around the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Florida) are actually plants of S. pseudogracile. In Central America, Solanum chenopodioides can be distinguished from S. nigrescens by the lack of stone cells in fruit, while S. nigrescens has always 4–13 stone cells per fruit. Anthers in S. chenopodioides are always much longer (2.0–2.8 mm) than in S. americanum (0.8–1.5 mm). The strongly deflexed peduncle and pedicels in fruit are distinctive in S. chenopodioides but are not always obvious in herbarium specimens."
wfo-0001027811,"Solanum emulans can be distinguished from other morelloids in North America by the small anthers 1.0–1.5 mm long, relatively long filaments 0.6–1.0 mm compared to S. americanum, calyx lobes longer than S. americanum and these appressed in fruit rather than strongly reflexed like in S. americanum, pedicel thickened at the apex in fruit (unlike in S. americanum), and pedicels that drop off with mature fruits (pedicels remain on the inflorescence in S. americanum). Solanum emulans has always 4–9(10) stone cells in fruits, while S. americanum either lacks or has maximum of 4 stone cells. Solanum emulans can be distinguished from S. interius and S. nigrescens by its shorter anthers, usually shorter calyx lobes, and usually unbranched inflorescences. When sympatric with the occasionally introduced S. nigrum, S. emulans can be easily distinguished based on anther length and the numerous stone cells in the berries, but S. emulans also generally has thinner leaves that are often purplish tinged beneath. In the Great Plains, the morphologically similar S. interius becomes more common than S. emulans, while along the southern East and Gulf coasts in the United States of America S. americanum becomes more common. Solanum emulans is not known from the Caribbean."
wfo-0001028687,"Solanum interius can be distinguished from other North American morelloids by its inflorescence with apparently uneven branches, one with several flowers and the other apparently with a single flower that is actually the basal flower with the articulation ca. 1/4 to 1/3 of the way up the pedicel, very like the pedicel articulation in wild potatoes. Other distinguishing features to be used in combination with this are the medium-sized anthers 1.8–2.5 mm long and relatively long rectangular calyx lobes with rounded apices. Solanum nigrescens has more regularly spaced flowers, occasionally branched inflorescences with more than one flower per branch and is more common along the Gulf Coast but distinguishing the two species without locality information can be difficult. The seeds of S. interius are much larger than those of S. nigrescens (1.8–2 mm versus 1.2–1.5 mm long) or any other of the diploid morelloids occurring in the area. Stone cell number can also be used as a distinguishing character; S. interius has 2–4 stone cells in each berry while S. nigrescens has more than 6 and often as many as 12. Solanum interius is sympatric with S. emulans and can be distinguished from that species in its longer anthers (1.8–2.5 mm long versus 1.5–1.8 mm long), its rounded calyx lobe apices, and its larger berries (10–14 mm in diameter versus 6–8 mm in diameter) with larger seeds (1.8–2.0 mm long versus 1.6–1.8 mm long). The flowers of S. emulans are usually smaller than those of S. interius. Nee (on label of Nee 61337) says that living plants of the two species are quite distinct, and that S. interius is a perennial growing in the shade of single trees."
wfo-0001021586,"Exodeconus integrifolius is recognised by its small, ovate to subrotate leaves with entire margin, its small (greenish/white?, not yellow) corolla and, in fruit, the strangely ribbed calyx. Since I have only studied one collection, the measures given are tentative. Further collections will hopefully confirm the diagnostic characters and hence, this taxon as separate from E. flavus. "
wfo-0001021585,"Exodeconus flavus is easily recognised by its yellow corollas and cordate to subrotate leaves. The dried, coiled up corollas are often long persistent on top of the developing fruits. "
wfo-0001021589,"Exodeconus prostratus is recognised by its ovate leaves with a blunt apex and also by its thin, reticulate calyx. Already in flower the long-haired calyx is a bit inflated and does not invest the corolla base tightly. In fruit the thin, big, reticulate calyx is often crowned by the dried, coiled up corolla. Note that in the original description the stamens are said to be unequal but even if the stamens of the type specimen are unusually unequal they are still more or less equal compared to E. integrifolius, E. pusillus, and E. maritimus. "
wfo-0001021588,"Exodeconus miersii is recognised by the form of its leaves in combination with large corollas with equal stamens. The filaments bear only few, minute stiff hairs. The testa cells are larger than in E. maritimus even if the seeds are smaller. "
wfo-0001021587,"Exodeconus maritimus is recognised by its leaves in combination with its large flowers with unequal stamens. The filaments have comparably long stiff hairs at the upper part. Rarely the leaves could have the broad sinuses at the base sides which is typical for E. miersii, but the leaves are longer than broad. The dried and coiled up corollas are sometimes persistent on the developing fruits. "
wfo-0001028351,"Only known from 6 collections (including the type), S. herbabona is restricted to the region around Vallenar in Atacama, extending south to the border with Coquimbo. The species is easily recognised by the leaves which are usually petiolate with truncate bases. No details are known of its habitat, and further collections are required."
wfo-0001028657,"Solanum indivisum is known from only three sheets, all collected in Chile in the nineteenth century. It is similar to Solanum trinominum and S. coquimbense in the strongly unequal length of the stamens. However, the long, narrow, sessile leaves of Solanum indivisum have a weakly dentate or subentire margin, in contrast to the strongly lobed leaves of S. trinominum and S. coquimbense. The pentagonal corolla, cuneate leaf bases, sessile leaves, and longer internodes are points of difference from Solanum coquimbense. No fruiting material is known and further collections are required."
wfo-0001026642,"Solanum brachyantherum is easily identified by the size of the flowers, which are much smaller than any of the other species of section Regmandra. The pinnae of the pinnate or bipinnate leaves are only about 1 mm wide, and are much narrower than those of S. remyanum or S. multifidum."
wfo-0001031072,"Solanum scabrum is the most commonly cultivated and widespread of the African black nightshades. It is the most important indigenous leafy vegetable in the black nightshade group, and is commonly known as the African nightshade. Solanum scabrum shows great variation in growth form, leaf shape and size, and berry number, in part due to the significant local variation introduced by human selection in cultivated populations. The species has also been introduced to Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States of America, S. scabrum is known as Garden Huckleberry, and its identity, origin and suitability to human consumption were the subject of great interest in the 1960's (as S. guineense). Different cultivars are recognised, the late flowering plants cultivated for their larger abundance of leaves with smaller number of fruits, and earlier flowering plants that have larger inflorescences which are cultivated for their fruits. Cultivated forms of S. scabrum stand out as quite distinctive; all forms have larger flowers and anthers that are often brownish in colour, while the forms cultivated for their leaves have larger, longer petiolate leaves and form cultivated for their fruits have larger, more numerous and shinier berries (the size of cherries) on erect or spreading pedicels. The pericarp in S. scabrum berries in all varieites is quite thick compared to other black nightshades, but mature berries of cultivars show variation in anthocyanin content where some individuals have dark purple mesocarp and others pale green. One of the major limitations to cultivation of S. scabrum as a leaf vegetable is the relatively low leaf yield due to early flowering and excessive fruiting. Wild forms of S. scabrum have often been called S. nigrum, but they differ from true S. nigrum which in Africa only occurs in the north along the Mediterranean in their congested inflorescences, spreading pedicels, calyx lobes that tear unevenly and long-petiolate leaves. Solanum scabrum can be distinguished from the somewhat similar S. americanum by its larger anthers (2-3 mm long versus 0.8-1.5 mm long). In these both species, as well as S. retroflexum, the berries usually lack stone cells (some populations of S. americanum can have up to 4 stone cells) and drop without the pedicels at maturity, leaving the pedicels behind on old inflorescences. In both S. scabrum and S. americanum, berries are purple-black and shiny, while S. retroflexum has matte purple-black berries with a distinct grey bloom. The pedicels of S. scabrum are usually erect or spreading."
wfo-0001025855,"Solanum alpinum is a plant of high elevations with both glandular and eglandular morphs. Glandular forms were named as S. viscidissimum, while in the same publication eglandular forms were named S. alpinum. Because the two names have not been synonymised before (neither name was included in Backer and Bakhuisen van der Brink 1965 or in van Steenis 2006), we have chosen to use S. alpinum over S. viscidissimum because the name is more generic and appropriate for the distribution of the species. It can be distinguished from S. americanum and S. nigrum, both of which also occur in Indonesia by its larger usually violet flowers on long pedunculate inflorescences. Anthers of S. alpinum are 2.8-3.8(-4) mm long, while those of S. americanum are minute (ca. 1.5 mm) and those of S. nigrum ca. 2 mm long. The leaves are usually narrower and longer (more lanceolate) than either of those two species, but two Horsfield collections with smaller, rounder leaves are included here based on anther length and flower size, so variability could be greater than we have seen. The plant illustrated as Solanum nigrum in van Steenis (2006: plate 51) is likely to be S. alpinum; the excellent illustration has the narrow leaves, long pedicels and large flowers characteristic of that species. The dismissal of it as a probable introduction has been the fate of all of the more narrowly distributed members of this group. The distribution of S. alpinum along the volcanic chain of Java above 2,000 m elevation is typical of other members of this rich flora that are found in areas created and influenced by fire resulting from volcanism, and subsequent open habitat and grassland creation (as described in van Steenis 2006). Solanum alpinum is likely to also occur in the tjemara forests (sensu van Steenis 2006) dominated by Casuarina junghuhniana Miq. (Casuarinaceae). Further fieldwork and more accurately geolocated collections are needed to ascertain the distribution and habitat preferences of S. alpinum."
wfo-0001029815,"Solanum nigrum, the type species of the genus Solanum, is a widespread weed with much morphological variation recognized at various infrageneric levels by many different authors and there are almost 100 names associated with the species. Solanum nigrum is morphologically similar to S. scabrum, but can be distinguished on the following suite of morphological characteristics; Solanum nigrum has leaves with rather indistinct petioles, inflorescences with the flowers spaced along the rhachis, acute calyx lobes that are more or less appressed to the berry in fruit, berries that are not markedly shiny, and berries that not markedly shiny and often have stone cells (particularly in Asia). Solanum scabrum has distinctly petiolate leaves, the flowers are usually tightly congested at the tips of inflorescences or inflorescence branches, the calyx lobes are rounded, irregular and strongly reflexed in fruit, and the berries are shiny with thick pericarp and lack stone cells. In addition, the fruiting pedicels of S. nigrum are spreading to somewhat recurved, while those of S. scabrum are erect and strongly spreading. Throughout its range in Europe and into Eurasia as far as western China, S. nigrum is sympatric with S. villosum. The simplest distinguishing character is mature berry colour; S. villosum has red, orange or yellow berries, while those of S. nigrum are black or green. Many old collections, however, do not state berry colour on the label, so identification can be difficult. Calyx lobes are useful for distinguishing these taxa; S. nigrum calyx lobes are usually deltate and acute, with sharp triangular sinuses, while those of S. villosum are longer, usually rounded at the tip and the sinuses are broad and quite transparent (see description of S. villosum), leaving a paler window just below the sinus in flower buds and early flowers. The shiny, translucent berries of S. villosum (mostly slightly ellipsoid) usually dry blackish brown, but are distinct from the matte, more opaque berries of S. nigrum. Neither species has stone cells in Europe, but in Asia, S. nigrum usually has 2 (or occasionally more) stone cells in the berries. Both species retain pedicels after fruits drop, but S. nigrum is not as extreme in this regard and often plants are found with old inflorescences with no remaining pedicels. Solanum nigrum has been considered native only to Europe, but our study of populations of this widespread weed across its range has shown that largest morphological variation can be observed in Asia. Populations of S. nigrum from Asia have more stone cells in the fruit, and the plants have a more delicate look overall with longer peduncles and often fewer flowers per inflorescence. Material from Asia has been described as different taxa (e.g., S. guanchounense, S. chenopodiifolium) but the variation is continuous across the range, with European populations being more invariant (except in leaf shape and indumentum). Populations in Europe represent a relatively monomorphic set of populations compared to material from China and eastern Asia. We therefore consider that the species is native to the entire Eurasian area, with limited introductions to North America. North American material we have seen appears most similar to European plants based on morphology, suggesting the introduction to North America came from European populations, but this has not been tested genetically. Australian populations of S. nigrum could have originated either from Europe or from Asia. In general, S. nigrum in Australia does not seem to have stone cells in general, and plants fall into two continuously variable groups: one is similar to classic European S. nigrum, and the other is more similar to plants from eastern and south-eastern Asia. In North America, S. nigrum can be distinguished from other Morelloids (e.g., S. americanum, S. douglasii, S. emulans, S. interius, S. nigrescens) in the character combination of thicker peduncles and pedicels, larger seeds and fruits lacking stone cells. It has longer anthers (2.5–3 mm) than S. emulans and S. americanum, both of which have tiny anthers ca. 1.5 mm long. Like S. nigrescens, it has inflorescences with the flowers spaced along the rhachis, but S. nigrescens has prominent stone cells in the berries and smaller seeds. Solanum interius has similarly large seeds but has fewer flowers per inflorescence and distinctive basal flower pedicel position (articulation above the join with the rhachis)."
wfo-0001030626,"Solanum pseudospinosum is a high elevation species that in our circumscription only occurs along the so-called Cameroon line that is along the junction of the Congo and West African cratons (Fitton 1987). We recognise the East African plants identified as S. pseudospinosum by Edmonds (2012) as high elevation, particularly pubescent populations of the more widespread S. tarderemotum. The key characters distinguishing the two species are the pedicel that remains on the plant after fruit drop in S. pseudospinosum, while those of S. tarderemotum drop with the berries, and the prominent articulations at the bases of the pedicels in S. tarderemotum. Other differences of S. pseudospinosum, but less easy to see, are the elongate, spathulate calyx lobes in fruit (those of S. tarderemotum are less hyaline and usually pointed) and the few-flowered congested inflorescences (as opposed to elongate, rather evenly spaced flowers along the rhachis in S. tarderemotum). Solanum pseudospinosum is also sympatric with wild populations of S. scabrum from which it can be distinguished by the dense spreading pubescence, the presence of stone cells in the fruit and the somewhat accrescent calyx lobes appressed to the berry. The Cameroon line along which Solanum pseudospinosum occurs runs from the island of Bioko to the Tchabal Mbabo plateau and is of volcanic origin with activity beginning the Cretaceous, but peaking in the Pliocene and continuing to the present (Wright et al. 1985). The island of Bioko is Pliocene in age (Wright et al. 1985) and been connected and separated from the mainland several times throughout the Pleistocene. Smith et al. (2000) found only weak relationships between populations of two bird species along the Cameroon line, suggesting they evolved by allopatry. Plant diversity in this area is among the highest in tropical Africa (Sosef et al. 2017), but despite having within it some well-sampled units (e.g., Mount Cameroon) the northern extent of the escarpment is very poorly sampled (Sosef et al. 2017: 12, fig. 7). Better field knowledge of the distribution of S. pseudospinosum, coupled with better knowledge of its habitat preferences and genetic structure, will help unravel the evolutionary history of this narrowly endemic species. Solanum pseudospinosum is a tetraploid species with unknown parentage (Olet et al. 2015). The species has not been included in any previous crossing and molecular studies that have focused on understanding the parental origin of the hexaploid species S. nigrum and S. scabrum (e.g., Edmonds 1977, 1979; Ganapathi and Rao 1985, 1986b, 1986c, 1987a, 1987b; Jacoby et al. 2003; Jacoby and Labuschagne 2006; van der Walt et al. 2008; Poczai and Hyvönen 2011). It could represent one of the tetraploid parents of the hexaploids, and should be included in further studies focused on understanding the origin of the polyploids."
wfo-0001029498,"Solanum memphiticum was long confused with S. villosum; both are similarly villous plants with toothed leaves that are sometimes pubescent with glandular trichomes. Edmonds (2007) clarified not only the differences between the two species, but also the identity and correct name for S. memphiticum. The species can be easily distinguished in fruit; S. villosum has characteristic red-orange (or yellow) berries with strongly reflexed calyx lobes, while S. memphiticum has green or black berries with the calyx lobes somewhat accrescent and covering at least a third of the berry. Fruiting pedicels of S. memphiticum are typically spreading and in live plants form a small bicycle spoke-shaped structure, while those of S. villosum are deflexed. Live plants of the two species are easy to distinguish: the leaves (glandular trichomes) of S. memphiticum have a strong foetid odour of rotting meat that is markedly different from the slightly pleasant odour of S. villosum. In flower S. memphiticum can be distinguished by its rotate-stellate corolla with small lobes that are strongly reflexed in flower, and calyx lobes that extend beyond the corolla sinuses in open flowers. The flowers of S. memphiticum are delicate and only last a short time as compared to other species (the corolla bruises easily), Leaves of S. memphiticum are generally longer and thinner than those of S. villosum, and the base is more decurrent onto the petiole so the free part of the petiole in S.memphiticum is much shorter than in S. villosum. The parental origin of the tetraploid species has not been investigated in detail. Jaeger (1985) suggested that S. memphiticum might be part of a more broadly circumscribed S. villosum, that included a wide range of fruit colours. Manoko (2007) showed that S. memphiticum (as S. grossedentatum) does not group closely with S. villosum based on AFLP data but forms a distinct group related to accessions identified as S. tarderemotum, S. chenopodioides, S. nitidibaccatum (as S. physalifolium), and S. tweedianum. Further molecular work based on sequence data will be needed to understand the relationships and parental origins of S. memphiticum, but possible diploid parents could be the morphologically closely related S. sarrachoides or S. nitidibaccatum that both occur in the Eastern Hemisphere. Both of these species are glandular and have an enlarged calyx in the fruit, characters shared with S. memphiticum."
wfo-0001030090,"Solanum opacum is extremely similar to S. americanum; both species have minute flowers with anthers usually less than 1.5 mm long. They co-occur across the Pacific, but can be distinguished easily, particularly in fruit. Solanum opacum has matte berries that are green or greyish purple at maturity, with appressed or slightly spreading calyx lobes, while S. americanum has very shiny berries that are black or dark purple at maturity and calyx lobes that are very strongly reflexed. The pedicels of S. americanum remain on the plant as fruits fall, while those of S. opacum drop with the mature berries. In flower, the relative lengths of filament to anther is a useful distinguishing character; S. opacum has filaments that are as long as or slightly longer than the anthers, while the filaments of S. americanum are always shorter than the anthers. Our circumscription of S. opacum encompasses a much wider distribution than that of Henderson (1974), who treated only the Australian populations. The treatments of Solanum nigrum or Solanum americanum in the Pacific could apply to either S. opacum or S. americanum. Degener(1945) records the use of morelloid species in Hawaii for both food and medicine; both species occur there. Solanum opacum is hexaploid and based on network analysis of arbitrary amplified DNA markers, Poczai and Hyvönen (2011) suggested that Australian populations of S. retroflexum were a possible tetraploid parent of S. opacum. The putative diploid parent is S. chenopodioides, S. nitidibaccatum, or some other closely related species (Poczai and Hyvönen 2011). Morphologically, S. retroflexum somewhat resembles S. opacum, but the shared molecular markers could also come from a common progenitor of the two polyploid species."
wfo-0001028050,"Solanum furcatum is similar to S. arequipense, an endemic species found to the north in western Peru. The two taxa have long been confused (e.g., Nees von Esenbeck 1843) and in our treatment of S. furcatum in its introduced range outside of South America (Särkinen et al. 2018), we considered them to be conspecific (e.g., Knapp et al. 2019: 67 illustrated S. furcatum with a drawing of S. arequipense). We recognise these two species here based on the subtle morphological differences that correspond to geographically distinct distributions. They are supported as evolutionarily distinct based on a molecular phylogeny that shows samples of the two species in distinct well supported clades (Gagnon et al. 2022). Both taxa exhibit the combination of a long-exserted style with the exserted portion equal to or longer than the length of the anthers, shallowly lobed corolla, calyx lobes separated by a paler sinus, forked to unbranched inflorescences (rarely several times branching), and usually large, lush leaves. The inflorescence branches of S. furcatum are less strongly divergent than those of S. arequipense, and the berries of S. furcatum always have more than six stone cells, while those of S. arequipense have only two or stone cells are absent. Solanum pentlandii also has similar globose buds and exserted styles but has much shorter anthers (less than 2 mm versus 2.5–3 mm in S. furcatum) and shiny green berries that lack stone cells. Solanum pentlandii occurs at high elevations in disturbed, nitrogen-rich areas in Peru and Bolivia and is not sympatric with S. furcatum. In the introduced range in the Eastern Hemisphere, S. furcatum can be distinguished from all other species based on its branched inflorescences, anthers 2.3-3.3 mm long, and flowers where styles are exserted up to 3.0 mm beyond anthers. IIt is potentially confusable with S. nigrum, but is distinguished from it in the characters mentioned above, and in its 6-14 stone cells per berry. Its subglobose buds are also distinct from the more ellipsoid buds of S. nigrum and S. villosum, but this character can be hard to see in herbarium specimens. In United States, Solanum furcatum can be distinguished from the similar and sympatric S. douglasii in its usually forked inflorescences, globose buds from which the style is often exserted, ellipsoid anthers on distinct filaments, and berries with usually more than 10 stone cells. Solanum furcatum is not sympatric with S. nigrescens but differs from it in the same set of characters and in its style that is exserted for as long as the anther cone (e.g., exserted portion of the style equal to the length of the anther cone).
"
wfo-0001029932,"Solanum nitidibaccatum is morphologically similar to S. sarrachoides and has been treated under both S. sarrachoides and S. physalifolium in many previous treatments. Solanum physalifolium is endemic to South-Central Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru to elevations between 2,000-2,900 m and does not occur sympatrically with S. nitidibaccatum. Solanum nitidibaccatum and S. sarrachoides are best distinguished by the complete inclusion of buds in calyx before anthesis, the larger stone cells and berries, and the more erect habit of S. sarrachoides. Solanum nitidibaccatum has shorter and more ovoid anthers compared to S. sarrachoides, where anthers are more elongate-ellipsoid, and the fruiting calyx of S. nitidibaccatum does not cover the berry as much as does that of S. sarrachoides. Solanum nitidibaccatum has been introduced extensively to other parts of the world where it has become a prolific and successful weed of disturbed sites usually associated with agriculture of the wool trade. Trade with South America - particularly the importation of grain, seeds and the spreading of wool - has been largely responsible for its introduction into Europe, with one of its common European names being the Argentinian nightshade. The taxon is now a widespread adventive in Europe where it is rapidly becoming naturalized and often forms extensive populations. It has been introduced into Australia on a number of occasions, where it persists as a weed of cultivation and is sparingly established in all States. The species is locally abundant throughout North America  where it is particularly widespread in the Pacific States and the West. It was introduced into the South Island of New Zealand around 1968 where it rapidly became established, and is now also found in northern parts of North Island. It also has been sparingly introduced into equatorial regions of Africa. In Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, S. nitidibaccatum can be distinguished from other glandular-pubescent morelloids by its minute flowers, with anthers 1–1.5 mm long. Solanum marmoratum, with which S. nitidibaccatum is sympatric, has similarly tiny flowers, but lacks glandular pubescence completely and has much larger, more distinctly marbled berries."
wfo-0001021590,"Exodeconus pusillus is recognised by its lanceolate to rhomboid leaves and its condensed habit. The colour of the dried corolla seems to be whitish with a bluish margin but herbarium labels say white, white with purple limb or pale violet. "
wfo-0001030827,"Solanum retroflexum is a species that shows great variation in its indumentum, varying from nearly glabrous to densely pubescent with either eglandular or glandular trichomes. The species can be distinguished from other Eastern Hemisphere morelloids based on the combination of characters of few-flowered inflorescences with 3-7 flowers, relatively long filaments (1.2-1.5 mm long) compared to anther length (1.3-1.8(-2.0) mm), strongly reflexed calyx lobes in fruit, and matte purple-black berries that lack stone cells and drop without the pedicels. Leaf shape is generally rhomboidal, which is characteristic of the species and helpful in distinguishing it from closely related S. nigrum and S. villosum. Calyx lobes are generally longer than in S. villosum, S. scabrum or S. nigrum. It can be distinguished from the morphologically similar S. villosum based on its opaque purple-black fruit, its pedicels that remain behind after fruits drop, deeply stellate corolla with long corolla lobes, and the long filaments as compared to anther length. In North America, the species can be distinguished from other morelloids based on a character combination of inflorescences with 1–4 flowers, filaments 1.2–1.5 mm long, strongly reflexed calyx lobes in fruit, and matte purple berries that lack stone cells and drop without the pedicels. Solanum americanum has similar small anthers and persistent pedicels, but the berries are very shiny and contain stone cells.
"
wfo-0001032383,"Solanum villosum can be easily recognised from similar species by its orange-red berries (ranging from yellow to bright red) that are slightly elongate and ellipsoid. The only other species present in the Eastern Hemisphere with pale yellow fruits is S. palitans, but this taxon differs in being prostrate plant with thinly membraneous 3-lobed leaves and is easy to tell apart. Rest of the morelloids in the Eastern Hemisphere have rounded or subglobose black or green berries. Solanum villosum is much more common in southern Europe than is S. nigrum, while S. nigrum becomes more common towards northern and central Europe. These latter two species are difficult to tell apart based on herbarium material alone, especially when mature fruit colour is not available. Calyx lobes of S. villosum are generally longer than those of S. nigrum (relative to width), strongly reflexed at fruit maturity, and the sinus is rounded (as opposed to acute in S. nigrum), and in flower the calyx tube has pale patches that look like small windows or white/translucent areas below the sinus itself. This is particularly easy to see in herbarium specimens. The leaves of S. villosum are similar to those of S. retroflexum in being usually more or less rhomboid with dentate margins, but leaves are more narrowly rhomboid than those of S. retroflexum (i.e., narrower relative to length). Specimens from the southern part of the range of S. villosum and the northern range of S. retroflexum (e.g., Malawi and Mozambique) can be difficult to distinguish in the absence of information on fruit colour (S. retroflexum has matte purple-black berries, also with strongly reflexed calyx lobes in fruit). Solanum villosum has generally distinctly longer filaments relative to anther length than other species (except S. opacum and S. retroflexum, see descriptions of these species), although large variation can be observed within and between individuals especially in herbarium specimens. Solanum villosum has a large capitate stigma that does not generally extend much beyond the anthers, in contrast to S. tarderemotum with which it often grows in sympatry in Africa, where the style is long-exserted and often bent and the stigma is smaller."
wfo-0001031661,"Solanum tarderemotum is a morphologically variable species. Edmonds (2012) recognised individuals with branched inflorescences as S. florulentum, and applied S. tarderemotum only to material with simple inflorescences, but branched and simple inflorescences can occur on the same specimen, depending on age. Intermediate material was occasionally recognised in some accounts under the unpublished name Solanum eldorettii (Olet 2004; Manoko 2007). Crosses between the forms of S. tarderemotum (as S. tarderemotum A, B, and C, and S. florulentum) yielded the full range of phenotypes, including intermediate individuals and both parental phenotypes (Manoko 2007). Solanum tarderemotum is distinguished from other sympatric species by its usually many-flowered inflorescences, long-exserted style that often is bent rather than perfectly straight (easier to see in live plants), spathulate calyx lobes that are rounded at apex, very strongly reflexed fruiting pedicels, and the berries that drop with the pedicel attached. Stems of S. tarderemotum are hollow and collapse upon drying, unlike the stems of the similar S. villosum that are more solid. Solanum scabrum also has hollow stems, but fewer-flowered inflorescences and larger fruits that drop without the pedicels. Solanum nigrum (North African populations), S. scabrum, and S. villosum all lack stone cells, while the fruits of S. tarderemotum consistently have 2-6 stone cells in each berry. Most material of S. tarderemotum is either glabrous or has eglandular pubescence, but plants from higher elevations in the eastern African mountains are glandular pubescent; these were identified as S. pseudospinosum by Edmonds (2012). Previous molecular studies identified S. tarderemotum form C (Clade IV) as a separate entity based on AFLP data that was analysed using Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic method (Manoko 2007). Individuals clustering apart from the main clade of S. tarderemotum and S. florulentum (Clade IV) showed simple inflorescences with fewer flowers, narrower corolla lobes, and green fragrant fruits at maturity ripe distinct from majority of accessions of S. tarderemotum and S. florulentum (Manoko 2007). The results from the AFLP phylogeny are not, however, supported by sequence based molecular phylogeny based on both rapidly evolving non-coding plastid and low-copy nuclear markers (Särkinen et al. unpublished). The accession on which S. tarderemotum form C (Clade IV) was based (NIJ 964750060) does not have locality or origin data, and hence, we prefer assuming that the collection represents morphological variation of S. tarderemotum as circumscribed here, supported by molecular sequence data. The differing relationships in the AFLP phylogeny in Manoko (2007) could be explained by general difficulty in interpreting AFLP banding patterns objectively in closely related species and highlight the issues in using AFLP data in phylogenetic analyses. Solanum tarderemotum is a tetraploid species with unknown parentage (Olet et al. 2015). The species has not been included in any previous crossing and molecular studies that have focused on understanding the parental origin of the hexaploid species S. nigrum and S. scabrum (e.g., Edmonds 1977, 1979; Ganapathi and Rao 1985, 1986b, 1986c, 1987a, 1987b; Jacoby et al. 2003; Jacoby and Labuschagne 2006; van der Walt et al. 2008; Poczai and Hyvönen 2011). It could represent one of the tetraploid parents of the hexaploids, and should be included in further studies focused on understanding the origin of the polyploids. 
"
wfo-0001025878,"Solanum americanum is a diploid species that can be easily recognised by its shiny black fruits on spreading pedicels with strongly reflexed calyx lobes (to parallel with the pedicel) that are somewhat papillate abaxially. In fruit, the pedicels remain on the plant after fruits fully mature and drop off, leaving behind a distinct group of tightly clustered spreading pedicels with reflexed calyx lobes; this character is easily visible in many herbarium specimens. In flower, S. americanum has tiny, almost globose anthers 0.8-1.5 mm long borne on short filaments. It can be distinguished from S. opacum, that also has tiny anthers of the same size, in its shorter filaments relative to anther size, and in its deltate calyx lobes with rounded tips. Solanum opacum has longer filaments relative to anther size, long-triangular calyx lobes, and in fruit, the calyx lobes are appressed to the base of the berry. Three other morelloids with such small anthers can be difficult to distinguish from S. americanum, and are often confused with it in herbaria. Solanum emulans Raf. is confined to North America and has matte berries and longer calyx lobes. Solanum nitidibaccatum also has extremely small anthers, but can be easily distinguished by its glandular pubescence and accrescent calyx in fruit. Solanum opacum also has tiny anthers and co-occurs with S. americanum across the Pacific. Solanum americanum is distinct based on its the shiny fruits (versus matte in S. opacum) and persistent pedicels with srongly reflexed calyx lobes are good characters by which to recognise S. americanum. In southeast Asia and China S. americanum is at least partially sympatric with S. nigrum (see discussion of S. nigrum). The species can be distinguished by anther size (0.8-1.5 mm versus ca. 2-2.5 mm) and by inflorescence morphology; S. americanum usually has few flowers that are tightly congested in the distal part of the inflorescence, while S. nigrum usually has more flowers that are more spaced out along the inflorescence rhachis, although young inflorescences of S. nigrum can appear sub-umbellate. In fruit, the srongly reflexed calyx lobes of S. americanum are distinctive, and the seeds are smaller than those of the hexaploid S. nigrum (ca. 1 mm versus ca. 2 mm long). In Central and South America, S. americanum can be confused with S. nigrescens. Solanum nigrescens differs from S. americanum in having larger anthers always more than 2 mm long, matte black or green fruits that are held on spreading or deflexed pedicels that drop with the berry, and calyx lobes appressed to the berry base in fruit. Berries of S. nigrescens have more than 5 (usually 5–6 large and several smaller) stone cells, while plants of S. americanum from this region have 2(-4). Inflorescences of S. americanum tend to be more sub-umbelliform in appearance than those of S. nigrescens, and calyx lobes of S. americanum are strongly reflexed and smaller relative to berry size in fruit. "
wfo-0001032187,"Solanum umalilaense can be distinguished from other African species of morelloids by its simple to branched and often leafy inflorescences, flowers with very short rounded calyx lobes and persistent, small, light yellowish brown fruits. Solanum umalilaense produces a large number of inflorescences such that at full anthesis the plant appears to be covered with white flowers, strikingly different from other species in the section (Manoko et al. 2012), except some populations of S. tarderemotum (the branched-infloresccence form previously recognised as S. florulentum). Like S. tarderemotum, the berries fall with the pedicels still attached. Manoko (2007) used AFLP molecular markers to assess the relationhips of the tetraploid African species, and found that S. umalilaense (as Sp. A) was a member of a cluster including S. retroflexum (as S. hirsutum (Vahl) Dunal and S. retroflexum) that itself clustered with S. tarderemotum. More field work is needed in southern Tanzania and adjacent Zambia to determine the true range and morphological variation of S. umalilaense; collections analysed to date come from what might be a single population.
"
wfo-0001028423,"Solanum hirtulum is a distinctive prostrate, creeping herb with narrow lanceolate attenuate leaves with strigose, somewhat antrorse pubescence. The flowers are larger than others in the group in Africa and appear to always be purple or blue; this, however, must be taken with caution given the high degree of flower colour polymorphism in other species. The inflorescences are usually few-flowered with tightly spaced flowers at the very tip. Solanum hirtulum is similar to S. memphiticum in having black berries with a somewhat accrescent calyx, but the flowers of S. memphiticum are always smaller, usually white, and more delicate (see description of S. memphiticum). The leaf bases in S. hirtulum are strongly attenuate, and decurrent onto the stem. Solanum hirtulum is a plant of Afromontane vegetation (sensu White 1981, 1983, 1993). Linder (Linder et al. 2005; Linder 2014) showed that this vegetation type (as Tropic-montane) was not necessarily a distinct unit across Africa, but instead was locally distinct based on high turnover in particular mountain blocks. Most clades from these forest types were Miocene in age (Linder 2014). For Ethiopia, Friis et al. (2010) further characterized this vegetation as moist evergreen Afromontane forest, with additional complexity added by the grasslands that are characteristic of the seral stages of forest regrowth in these areas. This forest type is only intact in limited areas (Friis et al. 2010); these are the forests where wild coffee grows, and are areas of high endemism in the Ethiopian flora (Vivero et al. 2006). It is likely that S. hirtulum also occurs at the lower levels of Afroalpine vegetation (sensu Friis et al. 2010), in grasslands at forest edges. The type of S. hirtulum was collected from the Simien Mountains, the most important hotspot of endemism for Afroalpine and Afromontane species (Vivero et al. 2006)."
wfo-0001030417,"Solanum pimpinellifolium is very closely related to S. lycopersicum and hybridizes with it freely. It differs from cultivated plants of S. lycopersicum in a variety of genetic characteristics, and we feel maintenance of S. pimpinellifolium at the specific rank will better serve both nomenclatural stability and the plant breeding community, who have long used this species in studies of tomato genetics (Frary et al. 2000; van der Knaap & Tanksley 2001). Since the two taxa are so similar, and identification of individual specimens can be problematic owing to putative introgression we use a suite of characters to identify S. pimpinellifolium. Our rule of thumb for identifying individual specimens (especially those that we suspect are of hybrid origin) was to assign to S. pimpinellifolium any specimen that possessed a majority of the characters below. 1. Corollas stellate, deeply (>3/4) divided, the lobes narrowly lanceolate 2. The sterile appendage of the staminal tube longer than the pollen bearing portion, making buds long and thin in comparison to those of S. lycopersicon. 3. Elongate inflorescence (greater than 3 cm) and many (>20) flowers 4. Very small fruits (<1 cm in diameter) 5. Few interjected leaflets 6. Leaflets entire or only slightly crenate in proximal 1/3 7. Terminal leaflet base cordate In addition, identification can be facilitated by observation of the terminal leaflets, broadly elliptical in S. pimpinellifolium rather than narrowly ovate (S. lycopersicum) and the overall velvety pubescence of very short trichomes in S. pimpinellifolium, without long trichomes (except in putatively introgressed populations). Populations in the northern part of the range of S. pimpinellifolium (coastal Ecuador) and occasionally in higher elevation valleys in northern Peru apparently are the result of introgression with S. lycopersicum and consequently have deeper crenate leaflets and often have a few stout, patent trichomes on the stems and inflorescences. There is great variation and difficulty in identification owing to introgression wherever the two species are in contact. In the Galápagos Islands, S. pimpinellifolium has been introduced or has only arrived recently, and forms hybrids with the endemic Galápagos tomato S. cheesmaniae where the two species occur in sympatry (Darwin et al. 2003; S.C. Darwin, unpubl.). Some plants identified by Nuez et al. (2004) as “Lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme” we assign to S. pimpinellifolium. Autogamous populations of S. pimpinellifolium have smaller flowers than outcrossing populations (Georgiady & Lord 2002), caused by heterochronic growth differences in the flower. A single QTL is responsible for four of six flower traits associated with autogamy (Georgiady et al. 2002), but much variation in all these traits exists in both sets of populations. Autogamy is associated with the margins of the range of S. pimpinellifolium (Rick et al. 1977), and studies of variation in nuclear gene sequences (Vac - fruit vacuolar invertase) in northern Peruvian populations (Caicedo & Schaal 2004a) show levels of outcrossing decreasing towards the south (towards the center of the species range). Caicedo & Schaal (2004a, 2004b) showed that genetic variation is high, and that there is no congruence between geographical distribution and genealogy in these populations. They suggest their data shows a northern Peruvian origin for S. pimpinellifolium, but they did not sample across the entire species range (into Chile). The more northerly populations in both their and Rick et al.’s (1977) study may have introgressed with S. lycopersicum. Solanum pimpinellifolium has been of great importance to tomato breeding for the introduction of important agronomic traits such as disease resistance, and for the investigation of the genetic control of traits such as fruit shape and size (e.g. van der Knaap et al. 2004). Crosses between S. lycopersicum and the TGRC accession S. pimpinellifolium accession LA1589 (an autogamous population from the lower Virú Valley in the Department of La Libertad, Peru) have been the mainstay of studies in fruit development in the tomato (see Morphology above) and LA1589 has recently been used in metabolic profiling (Schauer et al. 2005). Solanum pimpinellifolium had the lowest fruit protein content of any of the species tested, but its leaf metabolite content is very close to that of S. lycopersicum, further underlining their close relationship (Schauer et al. 2005). One TGRC accession of S. pimpinellifolium (LA1589) has been used to produce backcross recombinant inbred lines with the cultivated tomato. The 126 inbred backcross lines contain introgressed segments of S. pimpinellifolium that covers most of the genome. These lines have been important to produce genetic maps and analysis of quantitative traits (QTL) that are available from the Solanaceae Genome Network (www.sgn.cornell.edu)."
wfo-0001029216,"Solanum lycopersicum can be distinguished from the wild tomatoes by its bright red or yellow ripe fruit, usually autogamous flowers with the styles always included in the staminal column and its copious, long, trichomes that are often > 3 mm long. The only other tomato species with red, yellow or orange fruits are S. pimpinellifolium (with much smaller fruit and stellate, rather than pentagonal flowers) and the Galápagos endemics S. cheesmaniae and S. galapagense (with orange fruit and foliage smelling of limes). Solanum lycopersicum has been recorded on all continents except Antarctica, and is a widespread escape wherever it is cultivated, although in temperate climates it rarely survives the freezing conditions of winter. The species originated from western South America, but whether or not it ever existed in the wild or instead was derived by human selection from the closely related S. pimpinellifolium will be impossible to ascertain given its long use and wide transportation all over the world. The observation (see discussion of S. pimpinellifolium) that the two species hybridize in northern Peru and southern Ecuador lends some support to Brezhnev’s (1958, 1964) suggestion that the two are conspecific. Despite this possibility, we retain the two taxa as distinct species. Both names are widely used in the agricultural literature, and the two species are relatively easy to distinguish in the absence of hybridization. The use of fine molecular techniques is currently being developed for isolation of characters of breeding importance in elite breeding lines in the cultivated tomato as the genetic base has narrowed (Zamir 2001; Yang et al. 2004). These techniques may help to identify genes of potential utility in examining the history of cultivation and the relationships of these elite breeding lines to heritage and semi-feral cultivars.  Most previous workers in tomatoes have suggested that the cultivated tomato was derived from small-fruited forms called by many authors “var. cerasiforme”. Research into the genetic control of fruit shape and size in tomatoes has shown that the incredible variation in fruit shape seen in cultivars of S. lycopersicum is controlled by a very few tightly linked loci (e.g. van der Knaap et al. 2002, 2004) and that the small-fruited forms are not ancestral, but instead a mixture of wild and cultivated forms (Nesbitt & Tanksley 2002). Fruit shape in S. lycopersicum is a very interesting character state with which to explore the effects of few genes on broadly divergent morphology, and is being actively studied, especially using newly developed genomics tools.  Brezhnev’s (1958, 1964) classification of S. lycopersicum is replete with subspecific taxa. Brezhnev attempted to describe all details of the cultivars known to him. He classified escaped plants with smallish fruits as “subsp. subspontaneum” (a nomen nudum), indicating his belief that these plants represented feral or less developed forms of the cultivated tomato. He recognized six varieties of this subspecies, vars. “cerasiforme”, “pyriforme”, “pruniforme”, “elongatum”, humboldtii and “succenturiatum”, most of which are nomina nuda. These varieties were then seen to “rejoin” genetically to give rise to two geographical groups (Mexican and Peruvian). The large-fruited, highly morphologically aberrant forms were classified as “subsp. cultum” (again a nomen nudum), within which he recognized several “grex concultorum”, each defined geographically (“australioeuropeum”, “occidentalieuropeum”, “australirossicum”, “mediirossicum”, borealirossicum” and “borealiamericanum”). Each “grex concultorum” contained 3-7 cultivars with Russian common names (such as ‘Comet’ and ‘Korol Gumbert’). As with “subsp. spontaneum”, the “grex concultorum” were depicted in his diagram as derived from an amalgamation of all three varieties of “subsp. cultum”. His classification was an attempt to bring order to the huge number of tomato cultivars then grown in the Soviet Union, linking them to their supposed places of origin. Although Brezhnev’s work has been largely neglected by tomato workers in the United States and western Europe, it will be essential for anyone interested in examining the identities of cultivars and heritage varieties from that time. Khrapalova (2001) gave a complicated series of varietal and subvarietal names to many of these variants, but none of her names was validly published. In general, S. lycopersicum only persists as a feral plant in subtropical or tropical regions; frost kills the plants and the commonly cultivated forms behave as annuals, although they can persist for several years in the absence of frosts. Human transportation of plant material, both intentional and accidental, accounts for the wide distribution of S. lycopersicum. "
wfo-0001031853,"Solanum triflorum is a distinctive species with a prostrate habit, fleshy, usually pinnatifid, leaves, and deeply stellate flowers with long, thin anthers. The inflorescences usually have a small bracetole at the apex, and berry size varies from small (ca. 10 mm) to very large (ca. 20 mm), but usually a given plant has either small or large berries. Numerous stone cells are found in the berries, sometimes almost outnumbering seeds, and large berries can have as many as 30 stone cells. Solanum triflorum is a weed of agricultural areas, and appears not to spread aggresively. It is easily distinguished from other species by its usually deeply lobed leaves that are often pinnatifid (rarely only shallowly lobed), the usual presence of a bracteole in the inflorescence, very narrowly elliptic buds and berries with >30 stone cells per berry."
wfo-0001030176,"Solanum palitans is distinct among the species of morelloids occurring in the Eastern Hemisphere in its combination of uniformly 3-lobed, thinly membraneous leaves and pale yellow mature fruits. Solanum palitans is morphologically similar to S. tripartitum and the two species are sympatric. Solanum palitans has a creeping habit, with stems growing close to the ground extending up to 3 m and often rooting at nodes. Solanum tripartitum is an upright plant, the base not rooting if decumbent, with erect and branched inflorescences. Solanum palitans has unbranched inflorescences, whereas those of S. tripartitum are usually branched several times. The berries of S. palitans are yellow or pale yellow and often held near the soil surface, while those of S. tripartitum are bright red when ripe and not so disposed. Both species have two large apical stone cells in the berries. Solanum radicans differs from both S. palitans and S. tripartitum in its 5-lobed leaves, in its combination of a generally upright habit and orange or orange-yellow berries and its more northerly distribution. Solanum corymbosum has entire leaves."
wfo-0001029680,"Solanum multifidum is similar to the Chilean species S. remyanum, but is restricted to Peru. It may be distinguished by the usually glabrous leaves and the winged leaf bases that extend beyond the leaf node and in some cases may form a broad and conspicuous flap of tissue. There are a small number of specimens collected from the southernmost part of its range from the departments of Arequipa and Tacna that are intermediate between the typical forms of S. remyanum and S. multifidum. The leaf bases of these specimens are less prominently winged (although not as distinctly petiolate as specimens of S. remyanum), the pinnae are narrower, and the leaves are sparsely or moderately pubescent. However, the indumentum is not as dense as that found on specimens of S. remyanum. I have maintained these as two separate species as there is usually no difficulty in assigning the majority of specimens to one or the other species based on the indumentum and form of the petiole, and there is no geographic continuity between the two species. A similar trend in increasing indumentum density with increasing latitude can be seen in S. montanum and S. paposanum."
wfo-0001027198,"Solanum confertiseriatum is related to S. rovirosanum of Central America and Mexico (Knapp, 1991b). Solanum confertiseriatum is easily distinguished from S. rovirosanum by its elliptic leaves, more complex branched inflorescenes, smaller flowers with more prominent constrictions at the junction of the calyx tube and lobes and at the base of the calyx tube, reflexed calyx lobes, and its pubescent berries (occasionally with branched trichomes). Solanum confertiseriatum grows to be a medium sized treelet, usually with a single trunk. Trees growing in the open have foetid smelling leaves, while those growing in the forest have little leaf odor. Solanum confertiseriatum is extremely variable in both degree and type of pubescence, and can be either almost completely glabrous (with a few minute uniseriate trichomes on the inflorescence) or densely pubescent with dendritic trichomes. Plants with intermediate degrees of pubescence also exist. The density and branching of the trichomes seem to vary together, and appear to correspond to a gradient in aridity in coastal Ecuador and Peru. Forests are generally wetter in northern Ecuador and become drier as one proceeds south from the equator. Those specimens of S. confertiseriatum from Tumbes, Peru are the most pubescent and the trichomes are almost exclusively dendritic. Labels also indicate the plants come from dry areas. Solanum confertiseriatum is the only member of section Geminata, and one of only two species of non-spiny solanums, that is dioecious (Knapp et al., 1998)."
wfo-0001027114,"Solanum clivorum is probably most closely related to S. oblongifolium and may in fact be a geographical derivative of that species. It differs from S. oblongifolium in its usually difoliate, geminate sympodial units, smaller, more membraneous flowers, and smaller berries on more elongate deflexed fruiting pedicels. The leaf and stem trichomes of S. clivorum are generally smaller and with less elongate branches than those of S. oblongifolium. In both species, however, the trichomes are transparent. The five projections from the filament tube that closely invest the style in S. clivorum are occasionally present in S. oblongifolium. In S. oblongifolium, however, they are not as long and are not consistent within a given population. These projections are found in all known collections of S. clivorum. Two collections from Cutervo province (Sánchez Vega 4510, Sánchez Vega et al. 5960, both F) are unusual in their very large leaves, larger, waxier flowers and glabrous corolla lobes. They may represent merely a geographical variant, but could also be a different species. No fruiting specimens have been collected from amongst these populations."
wfo-0001030315,"Solanum pentlandii is easy to confuse with S. arequipense and S. furcatum, with which it shares small flowers with short anthers, long-exserted styles and toothed leaf margins. It occurs at generally much higher elevations than either of those taxa, and is usually more glabrous, with shiny, often more deeply and regularly toothed, leaves. Flowers of S. pentlandii are usually dark violet, as compared to the normally white or pale violet flowers of S. arequipense and S. furcatum. The flowers of S. pentlandii are smaller than either of those two species (corolla 0.9 cm in diameter, anthers 2–2.5 mm long and style 5–6 mm long in S. pentlandii; more than 1.2 cm in diameter, anthers longer than 2.5 mm and style 6–9 mm long in S. arequipense and S. furcatum)."
wfo-1200007610,"Lycianthes scandens var. flavicans is distinguished from the more common var. scandens by having larger and denser trichomes (usually greater than 0.25 mm in diameter versus less than 0.25 mm in diameter in var. scandens) which often make the calyx look woolly; in addition, the leaf veins are often prominent and white in color (versus obscure in var. scandens), the corolla is often white (versus purple in var. scandens), and the habit is often more of a shrub than a trailing vine (the common habit in var. scandens). This variety is also found at higher elevations (to 1300 m) than var. scandens (usually less than 500 m), and it is usually along the Pacific slope of Mexico and Central America, while var. scandens is more common along the Caribbean slope. The two varieties can be difficult to distinguish in certain regions, especially Nicaragua. The type collection from Jalisco, Mexico upon which this variety is based (H. Galeotti 1225F) has very small leaves, a form which is found in certain areas of the Pacific slope of Mexico. Other populations have much larger leaves (Dean et al. 2020).

wfo-0001022223,"Lycianthes armentalis is often confused with L. sideroxyloides Bitter, L. rafatorresii E. Dean, and L. scandens (Mill.) M.Nee var. scandens (previously known as L. lenta (Cav.) Bitter). Lycianthes armentalis differs from those species in its combination of multangulate-stellate (not geminate-stellate) trichomes, widely divaricate branching, calyx appendages that are not enlarged at the tip, white, shallowly stellate corollas, and unequal stamens. Lycianthes sideroxyloides has geminate-stellate trichomes, appendages that are enlarged at the tip, deeply stellate corollas, and equal stamens. Lycianthes scandens var. scandens has purple, mostly entire corollas and lacks widely divaricate branching. Lycianthes rafatorresii has similar flowers and trichomes to L. armentalis but lacks widely divaricate branching and has calyx appendages that are enlarged at the tip. Lycianthes armentalis occurs at relatively low elevations on the Yucatán Peninsula, a distribution that overlaps with L. scandens var. scandens, but not the other two species.
"
wfo-0001032576,"Solanum zanzibarense can be recognized by its small white flowers with long narrow corolla lobes, scrambling or climbing habit, slightly recurved or sometimes straight prickles over 2 mm long, and trichomes with stalks under 0.1 mm long and short midpoints. This species includes a wide range of populations across the Zanzibar-Inhambane regional mosaic (White 1983, Jaeger & Hepper 1986) in coastal eastern Africa from Kenya to Mozambique, encompassing a variety of leaf shapes and prickle morphologies. Jaeger (1985) separated S. vagans and S. zanzibarense citing differences in indumentum, leaf shape, inflorescence size, and altitude. Specimens with entire leaves and more sessile trichomes do seem more likely to occur further south into Mozambique, but this is not consistent enough to warrant their distinctness at the specific level. Solanum zanzibarense can be confused with the inland S. cyaneopurpureum and several more local species within its distribution range ( S. inaequiradians, S. lamprocarpum, S. stipitatostellatum, and S. usaramense) as well as the ubiquitous S. anguivi. Solanum zanzibarense can be distinguished from S. cyaneopurpureum by the following combination of characters; lobed leaves usually > 5 cm long (versus usually entire leaves <5 cm long in S. cyaneopurpureum), prickles usually present and over 2 mm long (versus prickles usually absent or under 2 mm long in S. cyaneopurpureum), branches long, slender, and prostrate (versus branches shorter and erect in S. cyaneopurpureum), and trichomes on the leaves and stems sessile or with stalks under 0.1 mm long (versus trichomes with stalks ca. 0.1 mm long in S. cyaneopurpureum). None of the distinguishing characters are applicable to all specimens, but the combination of leaf size and shape, number of prickles, habit, and trichome stalk length correlate with geographical distribution. Solanum zanzibarense differs from S. stipitatostellatum by its smaller flowers with corollas 1.5-2 cm in diameter (versus corolla diameter 1.8-3 cm in S. stipitatostellatum), anthers 4-6.5 mm long (versus anthers 6-8 mm long in S. stipitatostellatum), prickles over 2 mm long (versus prickles inconspicuous if present and less than 2 mm long in S. stipitatostellatum), and trichomes sessile or with stalks up to 0.1 mm long (versus trichomes with stalks 0.1-0.4 mm long in S. stipitatostellatum). Solanum inaequiradians differs from S. zanzibarense by its calyx lobes 7-9 mm long at anthesis and elongating to 10-12 mm (versus fruiting calyx lobes only up to 4 mm long in S. zanzibarense) and trichomes with midpoints 1-2.5 mm long (versus less than 0.2 mm long or reduced to glands in S. zanzibarense). The leaves of S. lamprocarpum can be reminiscent of S. zanzibarense, but S. zanzibarense can be distinguished by its recurved stem prickles (versus straight prickles in S. lamprocarpum), calyx 2.5-4 mm long in fruit (versus calyx lobes elongating to 8-10 mm long in S. lamprocarpum), and trichomes with reduced midpoints (versus trichomes with midpoints 0.7-1 mm long in S. lamprocarpum). Solanum zanzibarense is easy to distinguish from S. usaramense by its corolla 1.5-2 cm in diameter that is pale yellow in herbarium specimens (versus corolla 2.5-3 cm in diameter drying dull yellow to red-brown in S. usaramense), and corolla lobes 1.5-2 mm wide (versus corolla lobes 3.5-5 mm wide in S. usaramense).
"
wfo-0001020127,"Capsicum hookerianum is a member of the Andean clade. This species is unique in growing mostly in extra-Andean lowlands of coastal Ecuador and Peru and can be easily recognised by its dark brown stems, strongly decurrent leaves, intensely bright red fruits and conspicuous fruiting calyx with 10 unequal long appendages, which are sometimes reflexed. Apparently, the corollas have no brownish or purple pigmentation, since collectors only mention dull yellow or ochre corollas on herbarium labels. We were unable to locate this species in flower in the field. Capsicum hookerianum is sympatric with the widespread C. rhomboideum which is a more vigorous plant with dense, branched pubescence and multi-flowered inflorescences with up to 12 flowers; C. hookerianum has simple trichomes and 2–7 flowers in each inflorescence."
wfo-0001028594,"Solanum incurvum is one of the most infrequently collected members of section Pteroidea. It grows at the highest elevations, and is apparently not at all common where it occurs. Considerable variation in pubescence exists among the few specimens examined, which is apparently not correlated with elevation or any other discernible ecological factor. This variation in pubescence is common in the group, it occurs also in S. ternatum and S. mite. Like its close relative, S. ternatum, S. incurvum is reported to have lilac flowers, but white flowers also occur."
wfo-0001025782,"Solanum agnewiorum is a distinctive narrow endemic with sharply pointed leaf lobes, a dense covering of small curved prickles, and larger seeds than any other African Solanum species. Non-reproductive single stemmed seedlings are distributed in the forest understory, and when a canopy gap opens they grow attaching to other vegetation using prickles, developing into branched scramblers to 4 m tall and when flowering. Solanum agnewiorum is restricted to the remaining forest patches around Mount Kenya; for the full taxonomic history and discussion of habitat destruction see Vorontsova et al. (2010). Specimens of S. agnewiorum look deceptively similar to the common and hypervariable S. anguivi and its distinguishing characters in the fruit are easily overlooked due to scarcity of fruiting material. Solanum agnewiorum differs from S. anguivi by its scandent habit (versus habit always erect in S. anguivi), leaf lobes acuminate (versus rounded to acute in S. anguivi), 1-4 flowers and 1-2 fruits per inflorescence (versus 5-22 flowers or fruits per inflorescence in S. anguivi), fruits 20-25 mm diameter (versus 6-9 mm diameter in S. anguivi), and seeds 5.5-6 mm diameter (versus 1.8-2.5 mm diameter in S. anguivi). Similar forest scramblers that climb in surrounding vegetation with curved prickles include S. richardii, S. stipitatostellatum and S. inaequiradians.

wfo-0001031155,"Solanum selleanum is known only from the type and one other collection from the Dominican Republic I have not examined (Zanoni et al. 33773 cited in Liogier, 1994). Solanum selleanum is very similar to S. schulzianum, also from Hispaniola. The two species share deeply lobed to pinnatifid leaves, densely prickly stems and leaf surfaces and elongate, whip-like inflorescences with flowers in the distal half. Without looking closely at the pubescence and calyx morphology the species are almost identical on the herbarium sheet, but S. schulzianum has sparser leaf pubescence of porrect stellate trichomes with few rays and purple flowers, while S. selleanum has densely pubescent leaf undersides with a combination of porrect stellate trichomes with 8-10 rays and a dense fine covering of sessile stellate to multangulate trichomes and white flowers. The pubescence of the inflorescence in S. selleanum is glandular, while that of S. schulzianum is not. Solanum selleanum has broadly deltate calyx lobes rather than the distinctive long-triangular lobes with prominent sinuses of S. schulzianum. The calyx of S. selleanum appears to be dark purple, while that of S. schulzianum is green or whitish green. The taxa grow at similar elevations and in similar habitat and are probably closely related. Solanum selleanum has not been re-collected since the type gathering, and is a priority for collection in order to both assess its conservation status and its relationships to other Caribbean solanums.

wfo-1000023516,"Lycianthes talamancensis is morphologically similar and perhaps closely related to L. hortulana Standley & L.O.Williams, originally described from the cloud forests of Honduras, and L. breedlovei E.Dean, which occurs in the cloud forests of Chiapas, Mexico. All three species are densely pubescent with stalked, multangulate-stellate trichomes with rebranched rays, have widely divaricate branching, and have seeds that are usually notched on one side. Lycianthes talamancensis differs from the other two species in having longer pedicels, 15-22 mm long in flower, 27-35 mm long in fruit (rather than to 9 mm in flower and 13 mm in fruit in L. hortulana and to 16 mm long in flower and 25 mm long in fruit in L. breedlovei) and entire corollas that are moderately pubescent on the adaxial side (rather than stellate corollas that are glabrous or nearly so in the other two species).
"
wfo-0001027276,"Solanum cowieiwas long known by Australian botanists as a local morphotype, having been described by Cowie as Solanum sp. Litchfield as early as 2007. In Litchfield National Park, perhaps the most visited recreation area in the Northern Territory, three primary populations are on routes well travelled by day visitors and campers. The most collected population sits along the road to Florence Falls, with tour buses and cars passing on macadam nearly every day within 10 m of individual plants. Thanks to a series of biodiversity surveys undertaken by staff of the NT Herbarium over the last decade or so (e.g., Cowie et al. 2011, Lewis et al. 2010), the species is now known to have a broader distribution spanning from one side of the Top End from Limmen National Park near the Gulf of Carpenteria in the east to Keep River National Park and northward into the Macadam Range in the west. Across this range many characters remain constant, with leaf lobing (unlobed to slightly lobed) and density of prickles (absent to rarely dense) tending to vary the most. Vigorous post-fire regrowth has been noted in some areas of deep sand beneath open canopies, with one apparently clonal population in a ca. 20x20 m area around the Lost City consisting of ca. 40 ramets (Martine, Evans and Dugan pers. obs.). Resprout growth in this grouping was vigorous and well-armed (Fig. 2C), with numerous male flower buds produced on ramets 12-15 cm tall. While other species in this burn area had also begun to resprout, most had not yet developed flower buds - leading one to believe that the flowers of Solanum cowiei, once opened, would face little local competition for pollinators. While fire is thought to influence the life histories of other species in the Dioicum Complex (Symon 1980), little data exist on its direct effects on recruitment patterns. Previous molecular work (Martine et al. 2011) reveals that Solanum cowiei is a lineage within the Dioicum Complex - but its relationship to other species in the complex remains unresolved pending continued work in the group (C.T.Martine, in progress). Based on morphology, the species appears closely allied to Solanum dioicum and Solanum carduiforme, the latter species also collected during the Limmen and Keep River surveys. On sight, it differs most from Solanum carduiforme in its leaf shape, lobing, and overall growth form. The leaves of Solanum carduiforme are wider (5 cm across), long-triangular in shape, with well-developed lobes. Compared to all other solanums in the complex, Solanum cowiei is rather slight of habit, rarely getting taller than knee height and having poorly developed branching. Aerial shoots, while becoming weakly woody, are much like temporary structures, dying back to the underground stolons during fire or when outcompeted during gaps in the fire cycle - only to spring back to life soon after fires have burned. In support of its disturbance-adapted nature, much of the biomass in populations of Solanum cowiei appears to be below-ground. Stolons function in vegetative reproduction, but are also likely important for short-term energy and water storage in the sandy soils inhabited by the species. Stolons unearthed in the field snapped crisply and bore the smell of potato starch. Root systems extending from these stolons are coarse and poorly developed. The link of this species to fire may be the key determinant of the success of the species in individual sites. In unburned sites surveyed by the first author in the Lost City area of Litchfield National Park (in 2009 and 2013), individual plants were difficult to locate and devoid of reproductive structures. In recently burned areas plants were locally abundant, with budding ramets emerging from the sand at high densities."
wfo-0001345395,"This species is distinguished from other dioecious solanums in northwestern Australia by its short silvery indumentum, long calyx lobes, larger and compact stature, and a bony hard mature fruit that remains enclosed in a heavily armed calyx."
wfo-0001029368,"Solanum marantifolium was originally described as being in section Pteroidea, an unrelated group of fleshy forest herbs with axillary inflorescences (Knapp & Helgason, 1997). This species is probably closely related to S. longevirgatum, also of the western Andean slopes in southern Colombia. Solanum marantifolium differs from S. longevirgatum in its larger, minutely pubescent leaves with conspicuous primary venation, its minutely puberulent inflorescences bearing flowers only in the distal half, and in its smaller flowers. Solanum marantifolium is also similar to S. cyclophyllum and S. unifoliatum of Chocó department of Colombia. It shares with those species prominent primary leaf venation and large leaves. Both those species, however, are completely glabrous and have fewer main lateral veins (3-5 for S. cyclophyllum and 5-7 for S. unifoliatum).  The fruiting calyx of S. marantifolium is unusual in apparently lacking lobes (Daly & Acevedo R. 5176 from western Ecuador) and looking very similar to the calyx of many Lycianthes (L. synanthera group) or Witheringia species. The calyx lobes appear to abscise at the base just after the corolla falls off. This characteristic is unique to S. marantifolium and needs to be investigated further. Bitter, in his description of S. marantifolium, describes the calyx as ""in statu fructifero manifeste ampliatus, diam. fere 8 mm, lobis satis crassis obtusiusculis"". This sounds very like the appearance of the fruiting calyx I have seen. On the photograph of the holotype no fruit is visible."
wfo-0001029215,"Solanum lycopersicoides is sister to S. sitiens, and morphologically very similar. The two species are easily distinguished by the degree of leaf dissection; leaves of S. lycopersicoides are less finely dissected, and in general have fewer pairs of leaflets. The two species also differ in mature fruit color, the fruit of S. lycopersicoides is black or purple and still fleshy at maturity, while that of S. sitiens is yellowish and becomes dry and papery. The flowers of both species are very similar in overall morphology (non-coherent anthers, clavate stigmas) to those of members of Solanum section Regmandra (Dunal) Ugent (e.g., S. montanum L.) occurring in similar dry western Andean habitats. Section Regmandra however, is not closely related to the tomatoes (Bohs, 2005); perhaps the convergent anther morphology in members of sect. Regmandra and these taxa is related to pollination syndrome in these desert plants. Anthers are usually white in S. lycopersicoides, and its dehiscence initiated with the opening of two large apical pores that become long introrse slits. In the last flower stage the free stamens are loose on long filaments and the anthers are completely longitudinally dehiscent. Both S. lycopersicoides and S. sitiens have a strong chemical odor, according to notes on herbarium specimen labels. Solanum lycopersicoides and S. sitiens occur allopatrically at approximately the same elevation, and may also be reproductively isolated by flowering time (Smith & Peralta 2002). One TGRC accession of S. lycopersicoides (LA2951) has been of importance in the development of segmented introgression lines (IL) with the S. lycopersicum cultivar VF36. The 99 IL lines contains introgressed segment of S. lycopersicoides giving coverage of approximately 96% of the genome. These lines generated between these two distantly related tomato species have been important for producing genetic maps, and for exploring resistance to pest and pathogens, and cold resistance."
wfo-0001032176,"Solanum uleanum is certainly one of the most beautiful of the species of section Pteroidea. Its small size and peculiar (but found elsewhere in the section, see Solanum anceps) creeping habit make it conspicuously different from the other pinnate-leaved species. It has been considered a novel glasshouse plant, and was brought into cultivation in Germany (see Knapp, 2001). Despite its distinctive morphology, it can be difficult to distinguish on the herbarium sheet. Solanum uleanum differs from both S. conicum and S. mite (both of which are sympatric with S. uleanum) in its smaller, more rounded leaflets which are more winged onto the rachis (i.e. without a petiolule) and its greenish flowers. Fruiting specimens of S. uleanum have rarely been collected, but the elongate beak appears to be distinctive. As with all members of section Pteroidea, Solanum uleanum possesses great variability in pubescence density. The type specimen (a photograph in the original publication and the lectotype at G) is densely hairy, while other collections are almost glabrous. There appear to be no environmental factors influencing this, but more detailed field studies could help clarify the situation. Solanum uleanum often grows up trees at the edge of gaps or clearings in the forest, and individuals growing in the deep shade of the forest understory have much thinner, more membranous leaves. "
wfo-0001030768,"Solanum radicans is a member of a small clade containing the Andean species S. corymbosum, S. palitans and S. tripartitum. Like them, it is a small herbaceous species that often occurs in disturbed areas. It differs from S. corymbosum in its 5-parted leaves (versus entire) and orange (versus bright red) berries. From S. palitans and S. tripartitum it differs in berry colour (orange versus red or yellow), consistently 5-parted leaves (versus 3–4-parted leaves) and usually violet flowers with a prominent globose green stigma. The buds of S. radicans are often dark purple, but at anthesis the corolla is usually white."
wfo-0001031300,"Solanum sodomaeodes is a compact perennial of uniform appearance with narrow-oblanceolate leaves, a dense covering of curved light-colored prickles, and surprisingly big fruit for the small size of the plant. All the trichomes are stalked with elongated midpoints, but some populations have 4-rayed trichomes, and other populations have apparently simple trichomes with no lateral rays. Indumentum coverage varies from visibly woolly to fully glabrous. Many trichome stalks are lignified and large enough to be visible with the naked eye. It is important to use a microscope to verify the identity of this species because leaf shape can be deceptive. Individuals with uniradiate trichomes were originally described as S. capense var. uniradiatum, while individuals with 4 rays shorter than the midpoint were described as S. sodomaeodes and S. wilmsii. It may be possible to recognize uniradiate and porrect trichome forms at infraspecific level, but this character can be difficult to observe, and it is unclear where to place the glabrous plants. The two forms are equally common and no geographical separation seems apparent. Solanum sodomaeodes is partly sympatric with the sometimes superficially similar species, S. supinum. The Transvaal populations of S. supinum have long deeply dissected leaves similar those of S. sodomaeodes and unlike those of the S. supinum populations further east with larger more shallowly-dissected leaves; this highly dissected leaf shape in eastern South Africa could be a result of convergent evolution due to local environmental pressures. Solanum sodomaeodes can be distinguished from S. supinum by its inflorescences with 2-6 flowers and infructescences with 1-5 fruit (versus flowers and fruit solitary in S. supinum) and its trichomes with 0-4 rays (versus ca. 8 rays in S. supinum). Solanum sodomaeodes has also been confused with the partly sympatric S. capense, the only other South African Solanum species with wide-based hooked prickles. Bitter (1923) considered S. sodomaeodes to be a synonym of S. capense: perhaps the material available to him was insufficient to identify it as a coherent entity as Wright (1906) and Jaeger (1985) have done. Solanum sodomaeodes can be distinguished from S. capense by its trichomes with thick stalks, long midpoints, and 0-4 rays (versus sessile trichomes with reduced midpoints and 6-7 rays in S. capense), and long-oblanceolate leaves 3-4 times longer than wide (versus usually elliptic leaves 2-3 times longer than wide in S. capense). The correct spelling of the epithet is 'sodomaeodes' as -odes and -oides are correct alternative Greek endings indicating resemblance of something (Stearn 1992); the author's original spelling should be followed. "
wfo-0001029662,"Solanum moxosense is similar to S. flagellare and S. reineckii in its unbranched inflorescences and decumbent, creeping habit, but differs by its stems that are glabrous to sparsely pubescent with simple (1)2-4-celled hairs compared to the sparsely to densely stellate-pubescent stems of S. flagellare and S. reineckii.
"
wfo-0001347008,"Solanum michaelis differs from the co-occurring and morphologically similar glandular-pubescent S. sarrachoides and S. physalifolium in having larger anthers (2.5–3.2 mm long); both S. sarrachoides and S. physalifolium have anthers less than 2.2 mm long. Solanum physalifolium has similar shiny, green-mottled berries, but occurs at higher elevations (1,400 to 2,900 m) in ‘yungas’ or moist forest vegetation and has broadly ovate calyx lobes that partially enclose the fruit at maturity. Solanum physalidicalyx has similarly sized anthers, but a longer calyx tube (ca. 1.5–2 mm in flower and to ca. 5 mm or more in fruit) which is inflated and fully encloses the berry both during development and at fruit maturity (see Knapp et al. 2020). Solanum michaelis has similarly long calyx lobes but a shorter calyx tube in both flower (0.8–1.3 mm) and fruit (2–2.5 mm) that does not enclose the fruit and appears to sometimes have reflexed calyx lobes at fruit maturity (e.g., Fuentes & Navarro 2607). The more widely distributed S. tweedieanum has much longer anthers (4–5 mm long), whitish green mature berries and the calyx tightly encloses the berry during development, but the berry can be somewhat exposed at maturity."
wfo-0001347009,"Solanum woodii is unusual in South American morelloids having tapering, somewhat cone-shaped anthers with a beak-like tip; this character, however, can be difficult to see in older flowers with dehisced anthers. Among other glandular-viscid herbaceous solanums, it could be confused with S. tweedieanum and S. physalifolium. Solanum woodii is sympatric with S. tweedieanum but the latter species has longer calyx lobes in flower (3.5–5(–7) mm) and fruit (>5 mm) and slightly larger ellipsoid anthers (3–)4–4.5 mm long that are rectangular in outline (equally wide along their entire length) rather than broadest at the base; the calyx of S. tweedieanum is accrescent and completely covers the berry at maturity, while that of S. woodii is spreading and does not become accrescent."
wfo-0001429804,"Solanum medusae is most similar to S. lycocarpum, the wolf-fruit, in its large berries that are yellowish green at maturity, anthers with abaxially pubescent connectives, curved yellow prickles, and overlap in range with S. lycocarpum. It differs from that species in its unusual decumbent, spreading habit, in the dense glandular pubescence composed of simple, uni- to multiseriate trichomes that when dry give the plant a varnished appearance, and in its rigid, easily-broken subterranean system that grows shallow and horizontally in the soil, from which new stems can emerge in some points along its length (that in some cases can be mistaken as another individual). Solanum lycocarpum (popularly called “lobeira”) is an iconic element of Cerrado vegetation and ecologically important for populations of the maned wolf (Portuguese: “lobo-guará”; Guarani “aguará guazú”), and is a common small tree occurring in many habitats, especially open and/or disturbed areas of the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, and seasonally dry environments within the Atlantic forest domain in Brazil. The leaf pubescence of S. lycocarpum is composed of dense eglandular stellate trichomes such that the leaves usually appear densely felty and grayish green in live plants and grayish brown in herbarium specimens."
wfo-0001029125,"Solanum longifilamentum is most similar to S. macrotonum and S. nigrescens of northern South America. It can be distinguished from S. macrotonum by its longer calyx lobes (1–1.5 mm long versus 0.5–0.8(1) mm long) and filaments that are longer relative to the anthers (half the length of the anthers versus always much shorter than the anthers). The styles of S. longifilamentum are exserted to only 0.5–1 mm beyond the anther cone, but styles extend 1.5–3.5 mm beyond the anthers in S. macrotonum. Solanum longifilamentum has consistently narrower, oblong-lanceolate leaves as compared to the more ovate leaves of S. macrotonum. Solanum longifilamentum differs from S. nigrescens in its smaller flowers (0.5–0.6 cm in diameter versus 0.8–1 cm in diameter) with longer anthers (3–3.4 mm long versus 2–2.5 mm long), calyx lobes that are slightly reflexed at the tips at anthesis and strongly reflexed in fruit (versus tightly pressed to the berry in fruit) and its distribution in the Andes of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia rather than Colombia and Venezuela (extending into Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and the southern United States of America).
"
wfo-0001026513,"Solanum bellum is most probably closely related to S. unifoliatum and S. triplinervium from western Colombia, with unifoliate nodes and minute flowers, but is the only member of the species group to occur on the eastern slope of the Andes. Solanum bellum differs from those species in its fleshy leaves that dry pale on the undersides. The leaves on dry specimens are extremely pale on the undersides, and often the secondary venation is not at all obvious. Leaves of live plants develop a silvery sheen when growing in full sunlight, and are generally paler than those of other members of section Geminata."
wfo-0001028505,"With its closely spaced pedicel scars, geminate leaves, and rather stout (for the S. confine species group) inflorescences, S. hypocalycosarcum is related to S. pastillum and S. tuerckheimii of montane Central America. It shares slightly incrassate seed margins with S. leptorhachis, also of western Ecuador, but is otherwise not at all similar to that species. The tiny erect trichomes of the stems and inflorescences, and their absence from the leaves, are characteristic of S. hypocalycosarcum. The leaf shape of S. hypocalycosarcum, narrowly ovate and widest in the lower 1/3, is also quite distinctive. The relationships of S. hypocalycosarcum are enigmatic, and many more collections are needed to assess its variability and to further investigate characters informative as to its position in the section. Solanum hypocalycosarcum is not a common plant and is known from only a few collections. It grows near streams in the rainforests of southwestern Ecuador, and apparently is not found further north in the forests of the Chocó floristic province.Where I have collected this species I only found one plant, indicating perhaps that it has small population sizes where it does occur."
wfo-0001025872,"Solanum amblophyllum is a shrub of open areas at high elevations and is most similar and probably closely related to S. barbulatum of northern Peru. It differs from that species in its plurifoliate sympodia, branched inflorescences, larger flowers, and distinctive leaves. The upper surfaces of dried leaves of S. amblophyllum have an unmistakable crinkled, crêpe-paper appearance, making this species easy to identify. The flowers are large and fleshy but rather inconspicuous as they hang down amongst the foliage. The trichomes on the undersides of the leaves are quite dense and their structure is difficult to determine from dried material. The trichomes are always simple and uniseriate. The position of the trichomes is distinctive in S. amblophyllum. They occur on the midrib on either side of the primary nerves of the leaf and are not strictly in the vein axils as in S. barbulatum and members of the S. nudum species group. "
wfo-0001030814,"The following commentary is taken verbatim from Whalen et al. (1981):  Solanum repandum is very closely related to S. sessiliflorum of the western Amazon Basin in South America, and only with some hesitation do we retain it as a species. The two are essentially identical in habit, stellate vestiture, floral morphology, and fruit morphology. Among the characters that distinguish S. repandum from S. sessiliflorum are early-deciduous stem trichomes, somewhat smaller leaves, longer pedicels, smaller calyx lobes, and apiculate immature berries. Most of these are quantitative characters and there is some degree of overlap. If later students choose to treat this complex as a single species, they should be aware that the name S. repandum has priority over the later S. sessiliflorum and would have to be taken up for the tropical American plants. Solanum repandum has not been recorded from primary plant associations in Polynesia. Like S. sessiliflorum in South America, it is found only in association with human disturbances and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. Even the uses of the two species are similar in both regions. The berries are cooked in soups and stews and in fish and meat dishes, as well as being used fresh and for juice. Apparently, these are the only two species of section Lasiocarpa that are used extensively in cooked dishes. The presence of S. repandum as an endemic cultivated plant of the South Pacific presents enigmatic problem concerning its origin and dispersal. All that seems certain is that the species was derived from S. sessiliflorum or an ancestor closely resembling that species. Solanum repandum was discovered by Banks and Solander on the first voyage of the Endeavour (1768-1771), well before S. sessiliflorum was recorded from South America. When first discovered by Europeans, the South American and Polynesian plants were already as distinct morphologically as they are today. Therefore, dispersal to the Pacific must have occurred much earlier. Either dispersal by human agency or by natural means might have been involved. Certain circumstantial evidence can be marshaled suggesting humans as the dispersal agent. (1) Pre-Columbian Ecuadorians are known to have had sailing vessels capable of long ocean voyages (Doran, 1971), and the Spanish were known to have made voyages to the Pacific in early post-Columbian times. In 1595 the Mendana-Quiros expedition sailing from Piata, Peru, landed in the Marquesas Islands (Brand, 1967), the station for S. repandum nearest South America. (2) The indigenous name “cocona” used for S. sessiliflorum in Ecuador and Peru is rather similar to the name “kokoua,” used for S. repandum in the Marquesas Islands. (3) As noted earlier, uses of the two species in the two regions are similar. (4) The apparent absence of S. repandum from undisturbed vegetation in Polynesia suggests a human role in its survival. Successful establishment perhaps would have been much more likely following human dispersal than after natural dispersal Thor Heyerdahl (1963) has maintained that there were prehistoric voyages from western South America to Polynesia, and several American plants were postulated to have arrived in Polynesia as a result. Of these plants, it has been generally accepted that the sweet potato made such a voyage, but Brand (1971) has questioned whether there is any evidence to support the introduction of it into Polynesia before post-Columbian times. The Spanish are known to have carried American plants with them on their early voyages to the Pacific from Peru. In fact, Quiros mentions the planting of maize in the Marquesas Isalnds in 1595 and records the planting of several species in the New Hebrides in 1606 (Markham, 1904). The objection might be raised that if the Spanish had introduced Solanum sessiliflorum there would not be enough time for speciation to occur. However, if one assumes that one or a few seedlings became established on a Pacific island, conditions would be ideal for rapid evolution. As pointed out above, S. repandum is only doubtfully a distinct species, and the differences between it and S. sessiliflorum are hardly profound. It is probably not necessary to insist on a great length of time to bring about the necessary changes. If an introduction of S. sessiliflorum occurred either by prehistoric Indians or by the Spanish, probably the greatest difficulty is to explain how the fruits arrived on the coast of South America in the first place. At present S. sessiliflorum occurs on the eastern side of the Andes; and if the distribution was the same many centuries ago, we would have to assume that the fruits (or seeds) were carried across the Andes, reached the coast in good condition, and then somehow became included on a ship, accidentally if not intentionally. If humans were not responsible for the introduction, then natural means must be invoked. This offers no fewer difficulties than does the former hypothesis. Neither the fruits nor the seeds of S. sessililflorum seem suited for trans-oceanic flotation. Transfer by birds is the only plausible natural way by which seeds might have arrived in Polynesia. However, most birds that make long flights in the South Pacific are shore birds (Carlquist, 1974) and would have been unlikely to have picked up seeds of an upper Amazon plant. It should, however, be pointed out that birds would have had a far longer period of time to effect the transfer of the seeds than would have humans. Perhaps it was not seed of S. sessiliflorum that was carried to Oceania, but seeds of the common progenitor of S. sessiliflorum and S. repandum, which might have grown much nearer to the coast than does S. sessiliflorum today. If such happened, however, we would expect that a spiny form was introduced. On the island of Viti Levu, the largest in the Fiji Archipelago, an unusual simple-haired form of S. repandum predominates. The rather dramatic difference in vestiture is the only distinction between these plants and the stellate-haired form of the species found elsewhere in Polynesia. There are no intermediates, and we postulate that the genetic basis for the difference may be quite simple. Until the biological nature of the simple-haired form is better understood, we choose not to give it nomenclatural recognition. The occurrence of this kind of mutation may have been involved in the origin of S. pectinatum, a simple-haired species of section Lasiocarpa. We do not believe S. pectinatum and S. repandum are closely related, however. Molecular phylogenies of section Lasiocarpa remove some of the problems posed by Whalen et al. (1981) for the distribution of S. repandum. Although trees based on chloroplast vs. nuclear sequence data differ in the relationships hypothesized for some Lasiocarpa species (e.g., S. hirtum), both types of data consistently place the neotropical S. candidum together in a clade with the Asian species S. repandum and S. lasiocarpum (Bohs, 2004; Bohs, unpubl. data). Both types of data refute the hypothesis that S. repandum is closely related to the Amazonian species S. sessiliflorum and instead strongly support the relatedness of the two Asian taxa to S. candidum. Solanum candidum is found from sea level to about 1500 m in elevation and occurs on the western coasts of Central and South America; therefore, movement of fruits, seeds, or plants from coastal regions of the New World to the South Pacific seems more feasible than transport of an Amazonian species across both the Andes and the Pacific Ocean. However, it still remains to be determined how and when the ancestor of S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum arrived in the South Pacific and how the morphological differences between the two Asian species evolved. Poor resolution and conflicting gene topologies for species of section Lasiocarpa suggest that complex patterns of hybridization and introgression may be involved in many species in the section. Perhaps the same processes have contributed to the confusing morphological character suites seen in S. repandum and S. lasiocarpum. The application of the name S. ferox L. has not been critically examined at this time. According to Heiser (1996), S. ferox is the correct name for the species called S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum in Whalen et al. (1981). More research is needed to clarify the application of this name and to designate a lectotype or neotype for S. ferox L. Heiser recognizes two varieties of S. ferox. Solanum ferox var. ferox includes plants with prickly calyces that completely enclose the fruit. Solanum ferox var. lasiocarpum (Dunal) Miq. includes plants in which the calyx is not spiny and does not enclose the fruit. This latter variety encompasses domesticates as well as possibly wild plants and includes the species recognized as S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum in Whalen et al. (1981). Domesticated forms lack prickles, have large fruits, and in some cases have both simple and stellate-haired races. These have been called S. ferox var. repandum (G. Forst.) Bitter or recognized as cultivar group Domesticum within S. ferox. See Heiser (1996) and Hasan & Jansen (1994) for details. "
wfo-0001026241,"Solanum anomalostemon appears to be unique in Solanum in its cordate, sharply pointed anthers with a prolonged beak-like apex, which dehisce by longitudinal slits that are only poricidal very briefly at the beginning of anthesis. Otherwise, Solanum is remarkably uniform in basic anther morphology in the ca. 1500 species. Approximately 95% of the species are divided between two groups: (1) those with oblong anthers with relatively large terminal pores and later longitudinal dehiscence to a greater or lesser extent (the non-spiny solanums), and (2) species with attenuate anthers with very small terminal anthers that do not later enlarge (the Leptostemonum and Wendlandii clades [sensu Bohs, 2005; Weese & Bohs, 2007]). In other nonspiny solanums (excluding the Wendlandii clade [sensu Bohs, 2005; Weese & Bohs, 2007]), the anthers split longitudinally with age, but the pores are distinct at the beginning of anthesis (Knapp, 2002). Throughout Solanum many different types of anther modifications occur in almost all of the monophyletic clades in the genus (Levin et al., 2006; Anderson et al., 2006). Heterandry can be present, either by the unequal growth of a single filament (e.g., S. uncinellum Lindley of the Dulcamaroid clade [sensu Bohs, 2005; Weese & Bohs, 2007], or S. turneroides Chodat of the Brevantherum clade [sensu Bohs, 2005; Weese & Bohs, 2007]), or by variously unequal anthers (e.g., S. rostratum Dunal and all but one of the other species of section Androceras (Nuttall) Marzell of the Leptostemonum clade). Members of the Pachyphylla clade (sensu Bohs, 2005; Weese & Bohs, 2007, formerly Cyphomandra Martius ex Sendtner) have unusually thickened connectives, and in the tomatoes the anthers are tightly connate and have a sterile tip that functions as a single pore (Glover et al., 2004; Peralta et al., 2008). The Argentine species S. delitescens C. V. Morton, of the Geminata clade, has ellipsoid anthers that are narrowed and apparently sterile in the lower third. The anthers of Solanum anomalostemon are most like those of the small section Chamaesarachidium Bitter (S. chamaesarachidium, S. gilioides Rusby, and S. annuum C. V. Morton; considered part of the Morelloid clade on morphological grounds pending molecular investigation [G. Barboza, pers. comm.]). These tiny, often annual, plants of the high Andes have basally appendaged anthers, somewhat reminiscent of the cordate anther base of S. anomalostemonum. In habit and leaf morphology S. anomalostemon also resembles the species of section Chamaesarachidium: the plants are shrublets or small perennial herbs and the leaves are variously pinnatifid (Barboza, 2005). Solanum chamaesarachidium has glandular pubescence like that of S. anomalostemon, but has a marked basal connectival extension and is a much smaller, apparently annual plant (Barboza, 2005). The flowers of members of section Chamaesarachidium are usually somewhat campanulate at anthesis, as apparently are the flowers of S. anomalostemon. The seeds of S. anomalostemon are not tuberculate, as are those of all known species of section Chamaesarachidium. There are herbaceous species in the Andes of section Parasolanum A. Child (S. tripartitum Dunal and relatives) with somewhat similar leaves, but these lack the glandular hairs, and anthers are more typical of the nonspiny solanums. In molecular analyses it resolves as a species on a long branch related to the Morelloid clade (T. Sarkinen, pers. comm.).
"
wfo-0001022511,"This species is distinctive due to its epiphytic habit, abundant pubescence of branched trichomes, and truncate to shallowly lobed calyx margins without appendages. It is sometimes confused with Lycianthes nitida Bitter and L. synanthera (Sendtn.) Bitter, both of which have calyces that usually lack appendages as well as purple flowers. However, both of those species are glabrous to glabrate, lacking the dense pubescence of L. sanctaeclarae (Bohs 2015).
"
wfo-0001031897,"Solanum truncicola is a rare and unusual montane forest shrub or epiphyte. It is easily identifiable by its coriaceous leaves and long, almost linear calyx lobes which are divided to the base before the corolla begins to expand. The length of the calyx lobes (0.4-1.1 cm) in combination with the deeply stellate corollas with narrow lobes makes its flowers appear to be two overlapping stars (see Fig. 1F in Knapp and Vorontsova 2016). Petioles of S. truncicola are the shortest of all Madagascar Solanum species (1-5 mm), usually less than 1/8 of the total leaf length. The flowers can reach 3 cm in diameter, and anthers to 6 mm in length. Misidentification of S. truncicola is not likely, even though its height, internode length, and leaf size vary spectacularly across its distribution range: leaves of the type specimen are ca. 1.5 cm long, while leaves on other collections reach 13 cm. Some large leaved forms become reminiscent of S. myrsinoides in habit and can be distinguished from S. myrsinoides by their inflorescences of 1-2 (versus 2-6) flowers and calyx lobes 0.4-1.1 cm (versus less than 0.1 cm) long.
"
wfo-0001022467,"Lycianthes parasitica is distinctive in its epiphytic habit, usually strongly zig-zagging stems with markedly exfoliating white bark and berries with few (usually only two), large seeds. The epiphytic habit has evolved independently several times in the Solanaceae. The leaves are shiny on the adaxial surfaces and quite fleshy, in dried specimens the lower orders of venation are barely visible. In flower it is possible that L. parasitica could be confused with L. laevis, which similarly has 5 calyx appendages, but that species is a shrub, not an epiphyte, has larger flowers and berries with more than 20 rather than only 2 or 3 seeds. The calyx appendages of L. parasitica are usually not prominent in flower. The berries of L. parasitica change from green to white, then orange or bright red during maturation, whereas those of L. laevis turn only from green to orange or red."
wfo-0001020201,"Capsicum pubescens belongs to the Pubescens clade. Capsicum pubescens was domesticated and has been highly appreciated by early Peruvian peoples for 4,000 years before the present, while its introduction in Central America and Mexico has occurred in the twentieth century. Capsicum pubescens is very distinctive in the combination of the following characters, with minor differences in cultivars: habit, general pubescence, shape, size and colour of flowers and seeds and heteromorphic style. Capsicum pubescens is an erect to scandent shrub up to 4 m high, with a dense white, soft pubescence covering stems, leaves, pedicels and calyx (sometimes plants are glabrescent), with rugose young leaves, large rotate or rotate-stellate 4–8-merous corollas that are usually deep purple, heteromorphic styles with three different lengths and the largest brownish-black to black seeds (5.5–7 mm long, 4.8–6 mm wide) in the genus. Variations in corolla colour have been observed throughout its distribution, from dark purple to lighter tonalities (near rose colour) or completely lacking purple pigmentation. Pure white corollas (filaments and style white) have also been observed as a rare mutant in cultivated C. pubescens plants in Indonesia. The fruit is the most variable character in this species and its different common names refer to this. In the Andean highlands, the most popular names (and some deviations of these words), are “locoto”, an Aymara word (luqutu), meaning ‘piquant’, used in Bolivia (also in Argentina and Chile) and “rocoto”, a Quechua word (rukutu) meaning ‘pepper very piquant’ as is mostly known in Peru and Ecuador. In Central America and Mexico, the common names refer to fruit shapes and colours, to the sensation caused by capsaicinoids in humans or to a particular use in the cuisine. Fruits are large as in the other cultivated species and very attractive at maturity because of their shape and bright colours (red, orange-red, orange, orange-yellow, yellow, light yellow, nearly black). They can be more or less spherical, blocky or elongate; in the first case, they are depressed with the apex truncate or rounded, such as in the “canario” (bird canary, fruit roundish and yellow), “manzano” (apple-shaped and red) and “peron” (large pear-shaped and yellow fruit) varietals; the elongate fruits can be ovoid or elliptic, curved or not, with the apex truncate, rounded or acute and the base sometimes narrowed forming a conspicuous neck-like shape. In Mexico, C. pubescens fruits are also called “chile de cera” (cera = wax) in allusion to the soft and brilliant pericarp."
wfo-0001029464,"Solanum melongena is a cultivated to semi-wild herb with large shallowly-lobed leaves with rounded lobes and large white or purple flowers, grown for its large edible white, yellow, or purple fruits. Modern understanding of eggplant origins has its origins in work done by members of Richard Lester's group at the University of Birmingham (Lester & Hasan 1991). In this scenario ancestors of tropical African S. campylacanthum (groups A and B) gave rise to ancestors of southern African S. lichtensteinii (group D) and northern African S. incanum s.s. (group C). Solanum incanum s.s. is then proposed to have dispersed into Arabia and Asia, possibly aided by man because of the value of its berries for tanning hides (Bitter 1923). The eggplant was likely domesticated in Indo-China from the wild progenitor S. insanum, giving rise to the great variety of cultivars found there, including the more primitive prickly S. melongena (group G) and eventually the commercial cultivars (group H). Lester also hypothesized that escape into the wild could have led to the formation of small prickly weeds S. insanum L. (sometimes called S. undatum and S. cumingii, groups E and F, here recognized as S. insanum, see also Knapp et al. 2013). The relationships of the African eggplant relatives are supported by results from molecular phylogenetics (Weese & Bohs 2010; Vorontsova et al. 2013). Early domesticates recorded from 300 BC in India and from 59 BC in China are likely to have been small, globular, and bitter (Wang et al. 2008); the elongated fruit type is not recorded until the 16th century (Daunay & Janick 2007). For an account of cultivation history and early illustrations see Daunay & Janick (2007). The characters distinguishing S. melongena from the rest of the eggplant clade are mainly those directly associated with cultivation: larger fruit, altered fruit shape and color, and lack of prickles. Like the fruit crop cultivars of S. aethiopicum, it often exhibits fasciation in the flowers with an increase in the number of flower parts up to 8 and straight thick styles not exserted further than 2 mm beyond the anthers. Increased anthocyanin in the stems, leaves and corollas are likely an accidental by-product of selection for fewer prickles, as the loci responsible are located near each other (Doganlar et al. 2002). Solanum melongena can be distinguished from S. incanum by itslack of prickles or rarely straight prickles (versus curved prickles, rarely straight prickles in S. incanum) and moderate pubescence making the plant green-brown or reddish as herbarium specimens (versus dense pubescence making the plant pale yellow in S. incanum). Solanum melongena can be distinguished from S. cerasiferum by its obtuse to cordate leaf bases (versus attenuate leaf bases in S. cerasiferum) and rounded leaf lobes (versus rounded to acute leaf lobes in S. cerasiferum). Solanum melongena can be distinguished from S. aethiopicum by its mauve to purple corolla 2.5-5 cm wide and lobed for 1/4-1/3 of the way to the base (versus white corolla 0.8-1.8 cm wide and lobed for ca. 2/3 of the way to the base in S. aethiopicum). Solanum melongena can be distinguished from S. insanum by its lack of prickles or acicular prickles never more than 0.5 mm wide, and restricted to calyces and sometimes also stems and petioles. This division is to a certain extent artificial, but we prefer to maintain the cultivated and wild forms as separate species (see also Peralta et al. 2008 for a similar situation in the cultivated tomato, S. lycopersicum L., and its wild progenitor, S. pimpinellifolium L.); cultivated plants are in a completely different evolutionary environment with different selection pressures than their wild progenitors.
"
wfo-0001025760,"Solanum aethiopicum is a widespread vegetable crop, and includes all cultivated forms derived from S. anguivi. Solanum aethiopicum can be identified and distinguished from S. anguivi by a combination of the following characters: annual herbaceous habit, usually a lack of stellate indumentum, smaller and more entire leaves, 1-2 flowers per inflorescence, short and thick pedicels, more than 5 perianth lobes, ovary enlarged even at anthesis, fruit over 1 cm in diameter and with more than two locules, not detaching easily from the pedicels, immature fruit striped and/or not green when immature, and seeds over 2.5 mm long. Cultivars used as leaf vegetables are easily recognizable by their thin membranous leaves and dark red-brown, almost black color when dried; these may have up to 10 small flowers. Cultivars used as fruit crops have larger, often ellipsoid or flattened berries and 1-2 flowers per inflorescence. Precise limits of this species are difficult to specify due to the wide variety of infrequently occurring characters. Stellate indumentum is one such infrequently occurring character. Approximately 90% S. aethiopicum specimens we have seen are glabrous but some cultivars used for fruit (Gilo group) exhibit a variety of stellate indumentum types. Prickly forms of S. aethiopicum have been recorded from European botanical gardens (Lester and Niakan 1986), but are not known in Africa. Our knowledge of S. aethiopicum is largely due to the research program carried out by Richard Lester's group: crossing studies by Pearce (1975) and Omidiji (1975, 1979, 1982) followed by numerical taxonomy, protein electrophoresis, and further crossing studies by Niakan (1980) and Lester and Niakan (1986) have demonstrated that S. aethiopicum, S. gilo, S. integrifolium, and S. olivare are all interfertile cultivated races of S. anguivi. The cultivars have been separated into four groups: the Gilo group (with stellate hairs and large, fleshy, variably shaped fruits), the Shum group (leaf vegetable with no stellate hairs of prickles, small fruits ca. 2 cm in diameter, common in Africa), the Kumba group (edible leaves that are almost glabrous as well as sweet flattened and deeply-grooved [fascinated] fruits), and the Aculeatum Group (prickly plants, flattened and deeply furrowed fruit, common in European botanical gardens but not known in Africa). Solanum anguivi was maintained as a distinct wild to semicultivated species due to its largely distinct morphology, lack of wild intermediates, and a probable selective pressure against new hybrids between S. aethiopicum and S. anguivi. For a comprehensive account of the taxonomic history and an overview of different cultivars see Lester and Niakan (1986). We follow the circumscription of Richard Lester and place the without prickles Solanum distichum and its synonyms in S. anguivi. "
wfo-0001028672,"Solanum insanum is a woody perennial of moist and disturbed habitats with abundant prickles broader than 0.5 mm at the base and smaller leaves than the very similar S. incanum. It occurs further east and in moister habitats that S. incanum, with which it has historically been confused. Our circumscription of S. insanum comprises S. melongena group E and S. melongena group F of Daunay et al. (2001); this includes those plants considered by them to represent wild progenitors and straggling prostrate forms they considered to be feral reversions from cultivated forms. Populations of plants called S. incanum and S. insanum in India were thought to display continuous variability (Deb 1989), but the criteria for distinction of the taxa were not clear. Populations of S. insanum we have seen in southern China often have a mixture of forms; prostrate forms appear to grow in more open areas. Common garden experiments coupled with inter-lifeform crosses are necessary to determine the basis of this habit difference. Solanum insanum is almost certainly the wild progenitor of the cultivated eggplant and is fully interfertile with it (Daunay& Hazra 2012). Meyer et al. (2011) used AFLPs to test the relationships of wild and cultivated landrace eggplants and suggested that all Asian plants they analysed represented a single species (their S. incanum+S. undatum = our S. insanum) that was possibly of hybrid origin or had crossed repeatedly with local landraces of S. melongena. Regardless of which of these two scenarios is the case, S. melongena is likely to have had its origin(s) from amongst populations of Asian S. insanum, as Meyer et al. (2011) pointed out. Solanum insanum is used medicinally in south China and is considered distinct from the cultivated S. melongena by local people (pers. obs.). Because S. insanum and cultivated S. melongena are highly interfertile and repeated introgression occurred and is still occurring between wild and cultivated plants individual plants can sometimes be difficult to assign to species unambiguously. In this case we have adapted the method used by Peralta et al. (2008) for naming plants that were morphologically intermediate between the cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) and its wild progenitor (S. pimpinellifolium L.). They defined a suite of characters that distinguish each species and an individual specimen having a majority of one set of these is called that species. Table 3 in Knapp et al. (2013) lists the suite of characters we have used for the eggplants; for example, a specimen with several long-styled, 5-merous flowers, non-prickly stems and juicy green fruit pulp would be called S. insanum, while a specimen with prickly stems, rounded leaf lobes, one long-styled fascinated flower and large fruit would be called S. melongena. Fruit colour is not a particularly reliable character, as it changes through fruit development; S. melongena fruits are eaten when they are unripe, so the various green and purple fruits eventually become yellow or brownish yellow if left to ripen completely."
wfo-0001030509,"Solanum polhillii is an attractive erect pubescent shrub with conspicuous mauve flowers, broad pubescent leaves and apically inflated pedicels. Leaf size, petiole length and prickliness vary widely with aridity, nutrient availability, and herbivory; particularly remarkable is the variation in flower size, with the corolla reaching 2-4.2 cm wide and the anthers 4.5-8 mm long. The size of the flowers and fruits is intermediate between andromonoecious large-fruited and non-andromonoecious small-fruited species, supporting the non-monophyly of Bitter's original sections based on fruit size and sex expression (Bitter 1923).
"
wfo-0001029310,"Solanum mahoriense is a striking instantly recognisable species with large ornately lobed leaves, long-filiform calyx lobes, and the solitary berries fully enclosed by an inflated, accrescent, densely prickly calyx. The berry has a strong perfume-like scent, and the cut surface of the berry has a tomato-like odour (D'Arcy and Rakotozafy 1986). There are no obvious morphological similarities with other Solanum species in Madagascar, although an enlarged prickly calyx is also found in the small-leaved S. toliaraea in southwestern Madagascar.
D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) tentatively included S. mahoriense in section Cryptocarpum Dunal together with the New World species S. sisymbriifolium which also has an accrescent calyx and ornately-lobed leaves, but recent molecular work shows that S. mahoriense is a member of an monophyletic Madagascan clade well embedded in the Eastern Hemisphere Clade of subgenus Leptostemonum (Vorontsova et al. 2013), while S. sisymbriifolium groups with other New World taxa (Stern et al. 2011).
"
wfo-0001028963,"Solanum lanzae is a distinctive endemic of eastern African black cotton soils. Its greyish, long-elliptic, almost sessile leaves, lack of prickles, and small flowers set it apart from other Solanum species in the region, so much so that Lester (unpublished manuscript) suggested that it might not be native since no similar species are known from Africa. It has not yet been included in molecular phylogenetic analyses, but we are certain it is native to Africa and not an introduction. Illustrations and electron micrographs are available in Lebrun et al. (1995). Solanum lanzae bears a superficial resemblance to the invasive S. elaeagnifolium, from which it can be distinguished by its lack of dense lepidote pubescence and smaller flowers. The two species are not currently sympatric. Solanum lanzae has notable similarities with some populations of the southern African S. catombelense; both species have greyish green leaves and unusually small flowers and fruits. Solanum lanzae can be distinguished by its smaller narrower leaves, absence of prickles, usually terminal inflorescences (versus inflorescences appearing lateral in S. catombelense), and anthers 3.5-4.2 mm long (versus anthers 2.5-3.5 mm long in S. catombelense).
"
wfo-0001028558,"Solanum incanum is distinguished by its lobed leaves with a yellowish color when dry (herbarium sheets), and abundant long-stalked indumentum. In Africa it mostly occurs to the north of the Kenya-Sudan border. Prickles are predominantly gently curved in African populations, but collections with long straight prickles have been made in Arabia. Herbarium specimens of S. incanum bear striking resemblance to the similarly yellowish and densely tomentose southern African S. lichtensteinii; the two species are not sympatric and geographical location data can greatly simplify the identification process. Lester (fide Daunay et al. 2001) cites a difference in fruit diameter (1.6-2.1 cm diameter in S. incanum versus 3.5-4.5 cm diameter in S. lichtensteinii), but measurements from herbarium specimens suggest the ranges overlap, with fruits 2.5-3.5 cm diameter in S. incanum and 2.5-4.5 cm diameter in S. lichtensteinii. Solanum incanum is probably the closest African relative of the cultivated aubergine S. melongena (Weese & Bohs 2010), and forms part of a polytomy with S. insanum and S. melongena in an analysis with multiple accessions (Vorontsova et al. 2013); different markers will be needed to unravel the complex relationships in these close relatives of the cultivated eggplant."
wfo-0001027396,"Solanum dasyphyllum is a common plant of the African highlands. Useful characters for recognition include large leaves with pointed lobes and secondary lobing, attenuate leaf bases, straight prickles, and prominent elongate midpoints on the trichomes of the adaxial leaf surfaces. Some representatives have leaves that are less lobed, with rounded lobes, sometimes without prickles, and with variable quantity of indumentum. The sizeable porrect trichomes have a maximum of 4 or 5 rays, a useful identification feature seemingly overlooked by other treatments. Extensive sampling across populations in Uganda demonstrates that unlike the majority of African prickly Solanum species, the number of trichome rays in S. dasyphyllum does not exceed 5 (Bukenya & Carasco 1994). For SEM photographs and detailed information on trichomes, pollen and seed surface see Bukenya & Carasco (1999). It is widely accepted that S. dasyphyllum is the wild progenitor of the cultivated S. macrocarpon (Jaeger 1985; Gon&ccedil;alves 2005). Less hairy forms of S. dasyphyllum with fewer prickles and larger fruit were presumably selected to produce the visibly different S. macrocarpon. Opinions vary on whether to distinguish S. macrocarpon and S. dasyphyllum. Bitter (1923), Heine (1963), and Friis (2006a, 2006b) recognize them as separate while Bukenya (1980), Bukenya & Carasco (1994, 1999), Jaeger (1985), and Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) regard them as conspecific. The distinction between the cultivated S. macrocarpon and the wild S. dasyphyllum is largely artificial and maintained here for practical purposes; we feel that cultivated plants are experiencing an entirely different selection regime than their still wild progenitors, and that recognition at the specific level emphasizes this difference in evolutionary trajectory. Solanum dasyphyllum can be distinguished from S. macrocarpon by the presence of prominent prickles and indumentum, as well as fruit less than 4 cm in diameter (versus fruit more than 4 cm diameter in S. macrocarpon). Solanum dasyphyllum generally has larger and more dissected leaves, and its leaf lobes are more pointed than those of S. macrocarpon. Several species of native African and introduced Solanum have confusingly similar large leaves, pointed leaf lobes, straight yellow flattened prickles on both leaf surfaces, and elongated midpoints on trichomes of the adaxial leaf surface: S. aculeatissimum, S. cerasiferum, S. nigriviolaceum, and S. umtuma can all be superficially similar to S. dasyphyllum if not in flower. Solanum dasyphyllum can be distinguished by its lack of distinct petiole or long-attenuate leaf bases, almost rotate corolla on short-styled flowers, and only 4(5) rays on the stellae on vegetative parts of the plant."
wfo-0001026406,"Solanum aureitomentosum is a member of the eggplant clade recognisable by its neatly shaped velvet leaves with shallow, rounded lobes. It differs from the closely related and largely sympatric S. lichtensteinii by its ovate to oblong, foliaceous, 7-10 mm long calyx lobes on long-styled flowers (versus long-deltate, appearing less foliaceous, and 3.5-6 mm long calyx lobes on long-styled flowers in S. lichtensteinii). We have chosen to recognize S. aureitomentosum as a species distinct from S. lichtensteinii because of the correlation of velvety leaves and larger calyx lobes in many collections but gene flow with S. lichtensteinii is likely and it is possible to interpret these as one species."
wfo-0001029072,"Solanum lichtensteinii is morphologically similar to S. campylanthum and S. incanum and has the southernmost distribution of the three species. Specimens dry a characteristic yellowish-grey color and have pronounced ridges on the young stems. Solanum lichtensteinii is said to be more adapted for dry habitats than its close relatives having a long tap root and growing in deserts (Lester and Hasan 1991); its fruits reach up to 4.5 cm in diameter, the largest of all African spiny solanums (except cultivated species). Solanum lichtensteinii bears strong resemblance to the similarly yellowish and densely tomentose northern African/Arabian S. incanum; the two species are not sympatric and geographical location data can greatly simplify the identification process. The eggplant clade has suffered from extensive taxonomic confusion, but the distinct origins of S. lichtensteinii and S. incanum have been demonstrated by molecular phylogenetic work (Weese & Bohs 2010; Vorontsova et al. 2013). Here we accept S. lichtensteinii as a separate species from the largely sympatric S. aureitomentosum; S. aureitomentosum can be distinguished by ovate to oblong, foliaceous, 7-10 mm long calyx lobes on long-styled flowers (versus long deltate, appearing less foliaceous, and 3.5-6 mm long calyx lobes on long-styled flowers in S. lichtensteinii) and velvety leaves.
"
wfo-0001029370,"Solanum marginatum is named for its immediately recognisable leaves with white margins, white veins, and regular rounded lobes. A color painting of S. marginatum is available in Curtis's Botanical Magazine (Walker 1817). Solanum marginatum is said to have been introduced to Europe as an ornamental from Palestine by 1775 (Walker 1817). It is now found around the world, most likely spread by man (Symon 1981). It can be fairly common in nitrogen-rich soils around the major cities in the Andes, and has also been reported from the Middle East, Canary Islands, and southern Australia (Symon 1981). Solanum marginatum was cultivated in Ecuador in the 1980s as a source of solanasidine for the pharmaceutical industry (Roth 1986). Morphological differences as a result of andromonoecy in S. marginatum have been documented in detail by Dulberger et al. (1981). Only approximately 8% of all flowers set fruit and style length, anther length, and pollen production gradually decrease in flowers further up the inflorescence. The corolla is more deeply lobed at anthesis in the larger long-styled flowers, and is almost pentagonal in the smaller short-styled flowers. According to label notes on Gillett 5127, the long-styled flower corolla is greenish cream and the short-styled flower corolla is purple; we suspect this refers to a purple tinge on the smaller distal staminate flowers. Seed coat anatomy (Lester & Hasan 1991), crossing studies (Daunay et al., 1991), and chloroplast DNA data (Sakata & Lester 1994) have confirmed that S. marginatum is distinct from S. incanum and S. lichtensteinii."
wfo-0001027117,"Solanum coagulans is a variable and ubiquitous weed immediately recognized by its densely spiny accrescent calyx covering most of the berry. The androecium is zygomorphic with one anther protruding 1.5-2 mm beyond the others, although this is often difficult to see in pressed specimens. After the pericarp dries out the lobe apices of the accrescent calyx fall off, leaving dry bright yellow fruit enclosed in what looks like a truncate calyx but is actually only the fused base of the calyx lobes. It has been reported as an annual with a long taproot (Madgwick 11) or a perennial with a creeping underground rootstock (i.e., stoloniferous) (Bogdan 4735). Vegetative characters can be ambiguous in the absence of fruiting material but features useful for identification include the straight pale yellow spines and the yellowish green leaf color on herbarium specimens. Solanum coagulans and the rarer sympatric S. melastomoides form the zygomorphic-flowered Coagulans clade (Vortonsova et al. 2013) with one filament longer than the others and black seeds. Solanum coagulans can be easily distinguished from S. melastomoides by its accrescent armed calyx (versus without prickles calyx with the lobes not markedly elongating in S. melastomoides), the long stamen exceeding the shorter stamens by 1.5-2 mm (versus 4-6 mm in S. melastomoides), mature leaves over 5 cm long with more than 3 lobes on each side (versus leaves under 5 cm long, entire or with up to 3 lobes in S. melastomoides).
"
wfo-0001028131,"Solanum glabratum is a common prickly woody herb or subshrub recognized by its decurrent leaves with no clear petiole, glabrescent vegetative parts and abundant light yellow hooked prickles, and sessile, usually small trichomes with appressed rays and reduced midpoints. This species occurs as isolated populations from across Arabia and North Africa; plants of any given population are relatively uniform morphologically, but populations themselves differ markedly. Solanum glabratum is closely affiliated with S. hastifolium and constitutes the northern continuation of S. hastifolium s. l. The two species overlap in Ethiopia and Somalia, where some intermediate collections have been made. It may be possible to view S. glabratum and S. hastifolium as conspecific, but the majority of populations display consistent differences; S. glabratum is more woody, always erect (versus erect to scandent or climbing in S. hastifolium), with more abundant larger prickles that are always hooked, with orange or red fruit (versus fruit only red in S. hastifolium), with fewer, smaller, sessile trichomes (versus trichomes sessile or with stalks up to 0.1 mm in S. hastifolium), and occupies drier environments at higher elevations. The best distinguishing character for identification purposes is the lack of clear petiole in S. glabratum (versus clear petiole in S. hastifolium). The yellow hooked broad-based prickles, leaf lobes, and decurrent leaf bases of S. glabratum are highly reminiscent of the west coast populations of the South African S. capense. Solanum glabratum can be distinguished from S. capense by its reflexed corolla (versus corolla drying to cover the anthers in S. capense). Solanum glabratum can be distinguished from the sympatric S. forskalii and S. cordatum by its longer, narrower, sessile leaves.
"
wfo-0001029263,"Solanum macrocarpon is a glabrous without prickles leaf vegetable readily recognized by its rounded leaf lobes, attenuate leaf bases, foliaceous calyx lobes that often almost cover the developing fruit, and an easily recognisable red-black color in dry plants. A few specimens with unusual indumentum were seen with multangulate trichomes occurring in patches; these are likely to be mutations rising during cultivation and do not seem to have taxonomic or geographical significance. Distinct cultivars of S. macrocarpon have been described in Ghana (Bukenya & Hall, 1988). For SEM photographs and detailed information on trichomes, pollen and seed surfaces see Bukenya & Carasco (1999). The typification and early taxonomic history of S. macrocarpon is complex and treated by Burkill (1925), Jaeger (1985), and Hepper and Jaeger (1985). It is widely accepted that S. macrocarpon is the cultivated form of the wild S. dasyphyllum (Jaeger 1985; Gon&ccedil;alves 2005). Less hairy forms of S. dasyphyllum with fewer prickles and larger fruit were selected for cultivation to produce the visibly different S. macrocarpon. Opinions on whether to distinguish S. macrocarpon and S. dasyphyllum vary; Bitter (1923), Heine (1963), and Friis (2006a, 2006b) recognize them as separate while Bukenya (1980), Bukenya & Carasco (1994, 1999), Jaeger (1985), and Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) regard them as conspecific. The distinction between the cultivated S. macrocarpon and the wild S. dasyphyllum is to some extent artificial and maintained here for practical purposes; in our view the differing selection pressures experienced by cultivated plants and their wild progenitors necessitates their recognition as distinct taxa. Solanum macrocarpon can be distinguished by the absence of prickles and indumentum, and fruit more than 4 cm in diameter (versus fruit less than 4 cm diameter in S. dasyphyllum). Solanum macrocarpon also has smaller leaves, less deeply lobed leaves, and more rounded leaf lobes than those of S. dasyphyllum. Solanum macrocarpon can be confused with S. aethiopicum due to their similar round-lobed dark red leaves on herbarium specimens; S. macrocarpon can be distinguished by the absence of clear petioles and attenuate leaf bases (versus presence of petiole, obtuse to acute leaf bases in S. aethiopicum) and fruit above 4 cm diameter (versus fruit ca. 1-2.5 cm diameter in S. aethiopicum)."
wfo-0001030529,"Solanum polytrichostylum is a coarse erect herb morphologically very similar to S. antisuyo, with which it is broadly sympatric. It differs from S. antisuyo in its more elliptic (rather than ovoid) buds that are prominently striped with purple and white in both live and dried plants, flowering pedicels without a strong taper (as opposed to strongly tapered), its longer calyx lobes (1–1.5 mm versus 0.6–0.9 mm) with a distinct mucro apically and the larger number of stone cells in mature berries (6 versus 0–2). The anthers of S. polytrichostylum are slightly longer (4–4.5 mm long) than those of S. antisuyo (3–3.4 mm long), but this can be difficult to measure. The most reliable characters for identification are the bud shape and pedicel tapering, although S. polytrichostylum generally has more branched inflorescences than does S. antisuyo. Solanum polytrichostylum often grows in dense stands along river edges in otherwise cultivated areas."
wfo-0001020106,"Capsicum galapagoense belongs to the Annuum clade. It is the only wild native species found in the Galapagos Islands. It is unique in having dense pubescence throughout and the smallest flowers in the genus. It is superficially similar to C. annuum var. glabriusculum in its habit, lack of calyx appendages, white corollas, small, red, pungent fruits and pale yellow seeds. The two taxa are not sympatric. Three other Capsicum species grow in the Galápagos: 1) C. frutescens is cultivated or escaped from cultivation and can be distinguished from C. galapagoense in its sparse general pubescence, larger greenish-white to greenish-yellow corollas and elongate, conical fruits; 2) the commonly cultivated C. annuum var. annuum can be distinguished by its larger white corollas and diversely-shaped fruits; and 3) C. baccatum var. pendulum distinguished by its white corollas with greenish-yellow spots within and large pendent fruits."
wfo-0001027214,"Solanum conicum is superficially similar to S. mite in the vegetative state. Differences include the larger number of lanceolate to elliptic (rather than obovate) leaflets with long petiolules, its habit of becoming scandent and rooting along the stem, and its very conical fruit with a pointed apex and rugose surface texture. Leaflets are more elliptic than those of either S. uleanum or S. mite, and generally have strongly oblique, truncate bases. Solanum conicum can be confused with larger leaved specimens of S. uleanum, but the leaflets are not so decurrent on the rachis nor so rounded looking as those of the latter species. In southern Peru S. conicum more closely resembles S. mite than in other parts of its range and non-fruiting specimens are hard to tell apart. Like most of the other species in section Pteroidea great variation in pubescence occurs throughout the species range, with some very densely pubescent plants occurring in all areas."
wfo-0001030751,"Solanum quitoense is cultivated for its edible fruit in highlands of Colombia and Ecuador. It is used predominantly for juice and in preparation of refrescos with sugar and ice. The lulo is one of the most delightful of tropical American fruits, with a flavor reminiscent of citrus, and is rich in Vitamin A and ascorbic acid (Romero-Castañeda, 1961). Cultivation of S. quitoense is restricted by climatic requirements and susceptibility to root-knot nematode infection (Munier, 1962). It is most commonly grown in small plantings on newly cleared land. Wild occurrences of S. quitoense in Colombia and Ecuador are generally attributed to escape from cultivation. Volunteer plants are seen in disturbances and around habitations in regions where the species is cultivated. For reasons we do not understand, S. quitoense has been most successful as a weed in Costa Rica and Panama, where it was introduced into cultivation in this century. A few collections from montane forests in Colombia may represent native populations (Cuatrecasas et al. 12111 from Norte de Santander and Cuatrecasas 15031 and 22694 from the Cordillera Occidental in Valle). The regions in which these plants were found should be explored more fully as potentially important sources of germ plasm. Heiser (1969) speculates that S. quitoense was domesticated in highlands of central Colombia and transported by man to Ecuador and Peru. The basis for the argument is the existence of prickly forms and close relatives in the former region. The opposite direction of introduction, into Colombia from Ecuador, is postulated by Patiño (1962) and Schultes and Romero-Casteñeda (1962). Morphological data from Colombian and Ecuadorean plants point to a relative lack of variability in Ecuadorean S. quitoense. The pattern observed may be due to founder effect associated with human dispersal of S. quitoense southward in the Andes from a region of initial domestication in central Colombia as proposed by Heiser. Heiser (1972) pointed out the close relationship of S. quitoense to S. candidum, a wide ranging species extending from Mexico to Peru. The morphological similarity between these taxa is great, and the differences between them are primarily in characters that would likely have been influenced by human selection during the process of domestication. In particular, S. quitoense is without prickles or only sparsely prickly and has larger fruits with more readily deciduous hairs than S. candidum. An additional difference is the green flesh of S. quitoense fruits, an attribute of that species not found in any other members of section Lasiocarpa."
wfo-0001026216,"Solanum angustifidum is distinctive amongst members of the Dulcamaroid clade in having consistently pinnatifid leaves that are divided nearly to the midrib into usually three pairs of linear lobes; in general in the group pinnatifid and simple leaves both occur on individual plants. Although normally a shrubby plant, the petioles of leaves on terminal branches occasionally are elongate and twine around other vegetation."
wfo-0001027265,"Solanum corymbosum can be distinguished from other members of the Radicans group in its simple, entire leaves, small orange to red fruits with two large apical stone cells, its highly branched inflorescences and diminutive flowers with rotate-stellate corollas that are usually white adaxially and purple abaxially. Other members of the group have 3- to 5-lobed leaves (e.g., S. palitans, S. radicans, S. tripartitum), although a population of S. tripartitum from the Province of Salta, Argentina appears to be uniformly simple-leaved. Corolla size of S. corymbosum overlaps with these plants at its upper range, but flowers of S. corymbosum are generally smaller (0.5–1 cm in diameter) than those of S. tripartitum (0.9–1.1 cm in diameter), and S. tripartitum has more than two stone cells per berry. The two species are not sympatric."
wfo-0001025749,"Solanum adoense is a small procumbent shrub with numerous long straight prickles protruding from its stems at right angles. It is highly variable in its leaf size and the number of flowers and fruits per inflorescence; we encourage collectors to gather branches from different parts of the plant when making herbarium collections. The circumscription of the taxon here recognized as S. adoense has varied considerably over time. Bitter (1923) placed S. adoense within S. indicum L. at the level of subspecies, including a broad range of collections from Ethiopia and including S. indicum var. subquercinum Bitter. Jaeger (1985) recognized S. adoense at the level of species and broadened the concept of adoense to include forest populations with villous leaves and long midpoints from further south in Uganda and Kenya. Here we follow Friis (2006) and restrict S. adoense to small-leaved, moderately pubescent xerophytic populations in Ethiopia and along the Red Sea. Solanum piperiferum is the name often given to small-leaved plants of S. adoense scattered throughout its distribution. All populations south of Ethiopia previously identified as S. adoense are in fact members of the highly variable and widespread S. anguivi. Solanum indicum var. subquercinum shares all characteristics of S. anguivi except for its leaves with rounded lobes which resemble S. adoense; we include it under S. anguivi. Solanum adoense is sympatric with S. anguivi in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan, but is also found in Saudi Arabia where S. anguivi does not occur. In Ethiopia both S. adoense and S. anguivi usually have long straight prickles perpendicular to the stems, often leading to erroneous identifications. Solanum adoense can be distinguished from S. anguivi by its 1-6 berries per inflorescence (versus 6-22 berries per inflorescence in S. anguivi), 1-3 pairs of main veins on each leaf (versus 4-7 pairs of main veins on each leaf in S. anguivi), leaf lobes rounded or absent (versus leaf lobes usually obtuse or acute in S. anguivi) and leaves 1-8.5 cm long (versus leaves usually 11-25 cm long in S. anguivi). Solanum adoense is similar and possibly closely related to the inland S. macracanthum and the two species are frequently confused in herbarium collections. They share long, straight, and robust yellow prickles on the stem and the calyx. We accept the circumscription of Friis (2006a, b) but adopt a more narrow concept of S. adoense by not including plants with deeply-lobed leaves, large fruit and long trichome midpoints (such as the type Solanum indicum var. uollense that we recognize as a synonym of S. macracanthum); such plants were probably not seen by Friis. Friis (2006a) overemphasised the spatial separation between S. adoense and S. macracanthum, but they are in fact largely sympatric across the Gonder region and the central highlands. Solanum adoense can be distinguished from S. macracanthum by its ripe fruit 5-8 mm in diameter (versus 9-13 mm diameter in S. macracanthum), ovate to orbicular leaves 1-2 times longer than wide (versus ellipsoid leaves 2-3.5 times longer than wide in S. macracanthum), petiole 1/4-1/3 of the leaf blade length (versus 1/10-1/5 of the leaf blade length in S. macracanthum), and flowering calyx 3-5 mm long (versus flowering calyx 7-12 mm long in S. macracanthum).
"
wfo-0001029246,"Solanum macracanthum is a high elevation Ethiopian endemic. Its prominent straight prickles and its fruit over 9 mm in diameter, short petioles, and mostly subentire leaves make it a distinctive member of the Anguivi grade. Long midpoints on the trichomes are usually visible with the naked eye; these are always 0.7-1.5 mm long on the abaxial surface of the leaves but sometimes shorter on the young stem. The epithet macracanthum (large prickle) is descriptive of the long straight prickles but can cause confusion as the prickles of the nearly sympatric S. adoense are typically larger and more numerous. Solanum macracanthum is closely related to the more northern S. adoense and the two species are frequently confused in herbarium collections. They share long, straight and robust yellow prickles on the stem and the calyx. We agree with Friis (2006a, b) but broaden his concept of S. macracanthum to include plants with deeply-lobed leaves, large fruit, and hairs with long midpoints (such as those of the type of S. indicum var. uollense, which was not seen by Friis). Friis (2006a) has overemphasised the spatial separation between S. macracanthum and S. adoense. They are in fact largely sympatric across Gonder region and the central highlands. Solanum macracanthum can be distinguished from S. adoense by its ripe fruit 9-13 mm in diameter (versus 5-8 mm diameter in S. adoense), ellipsoid leaves 2-3.5 times longer than wide (versus ovate to orbicular leaves 1-2 times longer than wide in S. adoense), petiole 1/10-1/5 of the leaf blade length (versus 1/4-1/3 of the leaf blade length in S. adoense), and flowering calyx 7-12 mm long (versus flowering calyx 3-5 mm long in S. adoense). Solanum macracanthum is also sympatric with S. anguivi across its distribution range, although S. macracanthum tends to grow at higher altitudes. Solanum macracanthum can be distinguished by its ripe fruit that is 9-13 mm in diameter (versus 6-9 mm diameter in S. anguivi), calyx 7-12 mm long (versus calyx 3-5 mm long in S. anguivi), and always undulate or rounded leaf margins (versus leaf margins usually with obtuse or acute lobes in S. anguivi).
"
wfo-0001030447,"Solanum platacanthum is a rare creeping or erect shrub with white flowers and curved prickles. It has almost entire leaves with up to 2 weakly pronounced lobes, a fairly sparse indumentum, and dries with a yellow-orange tinge. The collection R. Spellenberg 7420 (Yemen, K) has only 1-2 flowers per inflorescence and may represent a distinct species. Species affiliated with Bitter's section Oliganthes are not thought to be andromonoecious (Whalen 1984), but J.R.I. Wood 1991 (Yemen, BM) was found to have a short-styled flower. Solanum platacanthum is similar and probably closely related to the widespread S. anguivi on the African mainland and represents the closest relative of that species outside Africa. Because of the broad variability of S. anguivi it is not possible to unambiguously distinguish S. platacanthum based on one or two characters, although it can be easily distinguished from North African S. anguivi. Solanum platacanthum can be separated from Ethiopian S. anguivi by its subentire leaves with rounded undulate margins (versus leaves with clearly defined obtuse to acute lobes in Ethiopian S. anguivi) and curved prickles (versus straight prickles in Ethiopian S. anguivi). Solanum platacanthum is superficially similar to the East African S. mauense Bitter with its subentire leaves, curved prickles, and yellowish drying colour; it can be distinguished by its sparse indumentum of sessile trichomes (versus dense indumentum with obviously stalked trichomes in S. mauense). Geographically, S. platacanthum is the member of the African S. anguivi group closest to the Asian distribution range of S. violaceum Ortega, but morphologically there appears to be little resemblance between S. platacanthum and S. violaceum.
"
wfo-0001027742,"Solanum echinatum is closely related to S. longissimum, but differing by the sparsely prickly branchlets with 3-80 prickles per dm (vs. 200-660 for S. echinatum); branchlet prickles 6-10 times longer than wide (10-20 times for S. echinatum); the dense stellate hairs on the branchlets (vs. very dense for S. echinatum); the very long petioles, 65-115% of lamina length (vs. 25-55% for S. echinatum); and the deltate calyx lobes 1-2.5 mm long (vs. rostrate to attenuate, 3-6 mm long for S. echinatum). Both S. echinatum and S. longissimum have numerous conspicuously stalked stellae, especially on the branchlets and rachis, but also to a lesser degree on the upper and lower leaf surfaces. The calyx prickles are extremely numerous, and there are always some smaller prickles with stellae mounted at the top (or, from the other perspective, long-stipitate stellae which are becoming prickles). By contrast, the stellae of S. senticosum (which grows in the same area) have stalks all about the same length with none conspicuously long. Also, none of the calyx prickles of S. senticosum have stellae mounted at the top. Hence S. echinatum and S. longissimum can be readily separated from S. senticosum in the absence of fruiting material. Symon (1981) counted (41-) 107 (-185) seeds per fruit in 14 fruits from three collections of S. echinatum and (192-) 254 (-330) seeds per fruit in 8 fruits of what he recognised as S. seitheae. Symon (1981) also noted that the plants of S. echinatum are usually rusty-pubescent or less frequently greyish; some very small leaved plants have also been collected and it is rarely clear whether this is a seasonal effect or reflects other causes. Prickles on the calyx vary in density and there is some evidence that cleistogamous forms occur. The fruits are finally shed when mature and plants collected in the dry season are often without fruits, especially if they are small. The prickly calyx and easily shed ripe fruit enable them to function as “trample burrs” and this is a probable means of distribution. The fruits of S. lucani are not so readily shed. The type of S. seitheae is indistinguishable from the type of S. echinatum. They both have fruits of about the same size, a dense rusty tomentum, some leaves with shallow lobes, and petioles less than half as long as the lamina. Symon (1981) originally distinguished S. seitheae from S. echinatum on the basis of its larger size, subshrubby habit, generally grey pubescence, and larger flowers and fruits. There are additional unnamed taxa related to S. echinatum in the Northern Territory, and S. wilkinsii is possibly distinct enough to warrant recognition at the species level."
wfo-0001028317,"Solanum hastifolium is a widespread polymorphic weedy species recognized by its lobed leaves, retrorse or recurved prickles, and inflorescences with more than 2 flowers. Sudanese collections more often mention S. hastifolium as a climbing plant, while we have only seen it growing as a shrub in Kenya. Ethiopian collections tend to have more entire leaves. The type collection is uncharacteristic of S. hastifolium; its leaves are more strongly hastate than typical, and its habit is more climbing. Friis et al. (2010) consider S. hastifolium endemic to the Somalia-Masai phytogeographical region but its distribution extends west into the Sudanian phytogeographical region (White 1983, Jaeger & Hepper 1986). Solanum hastifolium is morphologically similar and apparently closely related to S. glabratum, S. setaceum, and S. taitense. Solanum taitense and S. setaceum occur within the distribution of S. hastifolium. Both are locally common and uniform species that are morphologically similar to some forms of S. hastifolium. Solanum setaceum is easy to distinguish by the filiform bristles on its young stems. Solanum taitense is more difficult to distinguish reliably, as no single character separates all the specimens, but S. hastifolium has the majority of the following: lobed leaves 2.6-6.5 cm long (versus entire to subentire leaves 1.2-3(3.5) cm long in S. taitense), abundant prickles 1-4 mm long, spaced 3-10 mm apart (versus inconspicuous more closely spaced prickles up to 1(2) mm long in S. taitense), more than 3 flowers per inflorescence (versus 1-2(3) flowers per inflorescence in S. taitense), corolla 1.4-2 cm in diameter (versus corolla 1-1.7 cm in diameter in S. taitense), anthers 5-8 mm long (versus anthers 4-6 mm long in S. taitense), plant sparsely to moderately pubescent (versus S. taitense densely pubescent), and trichomes sessile to short-stalked (versus stalked trichomes on all vegetative surfaces with inflated trichome stalks on the adaxial side of the leaves in S. taitense). Solanum hastifolium is a more southerly species than S. glabratum, and where the two overlap in Ethiopia and Somalia rare collections with intermediate morphological charaters have been made. Consistent differences between the two species include the following: S. hastifolium often has a scandent or climbing habit (versus S. glabratum always erect), fewer grey or brown recurved or hooked prickles 1-4 mm long and 0.5-3.5 mm wide (versus hooked flattened yellow prickles 2-5 mm long and 1.5-5 mm wide in S. glabratum), red fruit (versus orange or red fruit in S. glabratum), more indumentum with larger trichomes that are often stalked (versus fewer small sessile trichomes in S. glabratum), and occupies wetter environments at lower elevations. The best distinguishing character for identification purposes is the presence of a petiole in S. hastifolium (versus leaf blade decurrent at the base and a lack of a clear petiole in S. glabratum). Jaeger (1985) suggested that S. hastifolium may be conspecific with the Indian S. trilobatum L. The two species are clearly distinct, however, and S. hastifolium can be distinguished from S. trilobatum by its more deeply stellate corolla (versus more shallowly lobed corolla in S. trilobatum), larger leaf length to width ratio (versus wider leaves in S. trilobatum), and yellow-green drying color (versus red-brown drying color in S. trilobatum). 

"
wfo-0001029727,"Solanum myoxotrichum is a striking forest species with stems densely covered in reddish long-stalked trichomes. The main stems have denser indumentum than young shoots, consisting of trichomes with lignified stalks that reach over 2 mm in length, mixed with mature prickles up to 7 mm long and sessile porrect trichomes. All stages of prickle development can be observed. The elongate multiseriate stalks of stellate trichomes thicken to become orange and more robust, and eventually form small acicular prickles with stellate trichomes on the apices; as the prickles continue growing the apical trichomes are deciduous and the tip becomes sharp. Solanum myoxotrichum occurs principally in the humid zones of Fianarantsoa, Toamasina and Antsiranana, with a few collections made in the subhumid zone of Antananarivo. The lower-elevation variants of S. myoxotrichum from drier habitats have shorter indumentum and show a gradual transition to the weedy and ubiquitous S. erythracanthum. Solanum myoxotrichum is maintained at species rank for convenience and because the number of intermediate collections is comparatively small; the somewhat intermediate S. forsythii is included within S. myoxotrichum on the basis of its wet forest habitat and relatively dense stem pubescence. Solanum myoxotrichum can be distinguished from S. erythracanthum by its calyx lobes of 3-7 mm long in flower (versus 1.5-2.5 mm in S. erythracanthum), copious indumentum on the main stems longer than 2 mm (versus glabrescent main stems in S. erythracanthum) and main stems usually wider than 4 mm in diameter (versus always under 4 mm in diameter in S. erythracanthum).
"
wfo-0001026788,"Solanum camptostylum is part of a group of native New Caledonian solanums with relatively small leaves and short shoots which typically bear the inflorescences. Solanum camptostylum is most similar to S. actephilum, but differs from S. actephilum by its shorter leaf length to width ratio, well-developed interpetalar tissue, and orange fruit.
"
wfo-0001028014,"Solanum forskalii can be recognized by the dense white indumentum of porrect-stellate trichomes on its young stems, and the abundant prickles. The variability within this species includes long and branched inflorescences with 5-20 flowers in Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and smaller 1-5-flowered inflorescences in Somalia and Kenya. The prickles are yellow, strongly curved, and very large in specimens from Egypt and Saudi Arabia but smaller, gently curved, and whitish or brown in specimens from Kenya. The trichomes are largely sessile with short midpoints for most of its distribution, but the midpoints extend to 1 mm in plants from some Egyptian populations. Solanum forskalii is frequently confused with the largely sympatric S. cordatum. Wood (1984, 1997) and Jaeger (1985) distinguished S. forskalii and S. cordatum primarily by the numbers of flowers per inflorescence and did not note indumentum characters. Solanum forskalii can be distinguished from S. cordatum more reliably by its porrect trichomes with 6-10 rays over 0.15 mm long on the young stems (versus multangulate trichomes with 12-18 rays under 0.15 mm long on the young stems of S. cordatum), 1-20 flowers per inflorescence (versus 1-2 flowers per inflorescence in S. cordatum), and anthers 4.5-7 mm long (versus anthers 3-5 mm long in S. cordatum). There is a clear morphological distinction between the two species in Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, where S. forskalii has branched many-flowered inflorescences and dense indumentum. The separation is less clear in Somalia, Kenya and the southern Arabian Peninsula; S. forskalii is more variable there with fewer flowers per inflorescence and smaller leaves. Carter & Stannard 583 from the northern Kenya appears morphologically intermediate between the two species, with long-rayed porrect stem trichomes and anthers ca. 7 mm long like S. forskalii,but leaf morphology similar to S. cordatum. Solanum cordatum grows in grassland or open woodland, sheds foliage during drought, and displays opportunistic growth in wet periods, while S. forskalii grows in more open and rocky habitats, preserving water throughout the dry season with its dense indumentum cover and tougher tissue. In Somalia S. forskalii is sympatric with S. cymbalariifolium, and can be distinguished by its porrect-stellate trichomes on the young stems (versus simple hairs up to 1.5 mm long on the young stems of S. cymbalariifolium), and actinomorphic flowers (versus zygomorphic flowers in S. cymbalariifolium).
"
wfo-0001031101,"Solanum schimperianum is a medium-sized shrub with uniform, entire ovate leaves and dense clusters of red-orange to red berries. The inflorescences are condensed on short peduncles with short rachises while the pedicels are long and the whole inflorescence can resemble an umbel. It seems that the habit can vary between erect and scandent. The majority of stellate trichomes on the abaxial lamina have 5-10 rays, with occasional appearances of multangulate trichomes with 15-20 densely packed rays. These trichomes are predominantly on the veins or leaf margins, but also occur on stalks on the main lamina. Leaves have been reported as sticky, most likely due to the minute gland-tipped hairs mixed with the larger stellate trichomes. The African populations are generally smaller-leaved and vary between densely stellate-pubescent and almost glabrous; populations in Arabia are usually almost glabrous with larger leaves. Unusual small-leaved specimens have smaller inflorescences and can be difficult to recognize as S. schimperianum: these occur both in Africa (e.g. Hemming 35, Somalia, K) and the Middle East (e.g. Collenette 1251, Saudi Arabia, K). Occasional collections have some leaf lobing on fertile branches, e.g. Henry 20/76 (Yemen, K) and Collenette 7385 (Saudi Arabia, K). The vegetative and fruiting morphology of S. schimperianum is deceptively similar to the zygomorphic-flowered S. somalense and the two species have suffered from historic confusion after C. H. Wright (1906) cited specimens of S. somalense as S. carense, a synonym of S. schimperianum. When flowering material is available it is obvious that S. schimperianum has pale mauve rotate flowers 1.3-2 cm in diameter and equal anthers 3.5-4.5 mm long, while S. somalense has deep mauve to purple zygomorphic flowers 2-3 cm in diameter with 4 anthers 5-8 mm long and the lowermost anther 8-11 mm long. Identifying the two species without flowers is more difficult; S. schimperianum can be distinguished by its erect to scandent or scrambling habit (versus habit always erect in S. somalense), orange-red to red berries (versus bright orange berries in S. somalense), and smaller seeds 2.5-3.8x2-2.8 mm (versus in 3.8-5x3.5-3.8 mm S. somalense). Solanum schimperianum usually has wider leaves than S. somalense. Both species occur in northern Somalia but they are not sympatric, as S. schimperianum occurs at higher elevations at 1500-2800 m while S. somalense is found at 0-1300 m elevation. The closest relative of S. schimperianum is almost certainly the variable southern species S. tettense. Solanum schimperianum and S. tettense are mostly allopatric; both species occur in Somalia but S. schimperianum is in the northern mountains while S. tettense is only found in the southernmost tip of the country. Solanum tettense is common in Ethiopia's Sidamo Region and one specimen of S. schimperianum is also known from Sidamo but at higher altitude than S. tettense. The two species also occupy different altitudinal belts; no intermediate specimens have been seen. Solanum schimperianum and S. tettense can have the same number of flowers per inflorescence but the inflorescence structure is different. Solanum schimperianum can be distinguished from S. tettense by its peduncles 0.3-1.5 cm long (versus peduncles 1.5-4.5 cm long in S. tettense), rachis 0.5-1(2) cm long (versus rachis 1.5-6 cm long in S. tettense), pedicels (0.8)1-2.3 cm long (versus pedicels 0.4-1(1.5) cm long in S. tettense), lack of prickles (versus deltate prickles often present on older stems of S. tettense), and largely concolorous membranous leaves (versus strongly discolorous chartaceous leaves in S. tettense)."
wfo-0001031756,"Solanum toliaraea is a morphologically uniform narrow endemic, easy to recognize by its accrescent, inflated, prickly fruiting calyx. The calyx is moderately sized and without prickles at anthesis but expands to enclose the fruit, and prickles appear on its basal portion and spread to cover the entire surface of the calyx except the free apical lobes. The only other Madagascar Solanum species with a spiny inflated calyx is the large-leaved S. mahoriense from the wet northern forests. Solanum toliaraea has no obvious close relatives but without a fruit it can be difficult to distinguish from the sympatric S. batoides: S. toliaraea differs from S. batoides in its leaves that are regularly ovate, concolorous, and yellow green (versus orbicular to elliptic or ovate, concolorous to discolorous yellow-green to brown-green leaves in S. batoides) and stem trichomes with 9-14 rays (versus 7-9 rays in S. batoides).
"
wfo-0001027847,"Solanum erythracanthum is the most common of the Solanum species endemic to Madagascar and has been noted as ecologically troublesome and highly resistant to human disturbance (D'Arcy 1992). It displays remarkable phenotypic plasticity and encompasses a great range of variation, especially in leaf size and shape, with subentire to ornate lobing, sporadic occurrence of minor leaves, and color and shape of prickles. The most common morphotype (S. erythracanthum s.s. as described by Dunal 1852, and Bitter 1923) is a small-leaved weedy shrub with reddish young shoots, dense indumentum, frequently lobed leaves and up to 3 (rarely 4) flowers per inflorescence. The species concept adopted here is broadly similar to that used by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) and includes two morphotypes known from single collections and recognized as separate species by Jaeger (1985): S. nossibeense and S. flagelliferum. Solanum nossibeense appears to have small-leaved branches similar to S. erythracanthum and large-leaved branches with subentire leaves and numerous tetramerous flowers leading to placement in section Torva by Jaeger (close to S. tettense in the Giganteum group in the present system; both morphotypes are visible on one specimen in Perville 357 [P00349146]). Solanum flagelliferum was recognized on the basis of its entire acuminate leaves and long petioles. A considerable number of single aberrant collections are also known which could indicate undescribed species or fall within morphological variability within S. erythracanthum. Solanum erythracanthum grows in dry to mesic environments and to some extent intergrades into the prickly large-leaved S. myoxotrichum from the wetter highland forests in northeastern Madagascar in terms of stem pubescence and leaf size. We accept these as separate species for convenience and because the number of intermediate collections in the above characters is comparatively small. Solanum erythracanthum can be distinguished from S. myoxotrichum by its indumentum on the main stems under 3 mm long (versus over 3 mm long in S. myoxotrichum), and calyx lobes 1.5-2.5 mm long in flower (versus 3-7 mm long in S. myoxotrichum). Solanum erythracanthum differs from S. batoides in its leaves over 2 cm long (versus under 2 cm long in S. batoides), at least some leaves growing on the main stems (versus all leaves on small short shoots in S. batoides) and main branches over 2.5 mm in diameter (versus under 3 mm in S. batoides). Solanum erythracanthum was common in cultivation in Europe in the 19th century, and a large number of collections in European herbaria are possibly derived from a few early introductions.
"
wfo-0001030125,"As with many Solanum species with recurved prickles, Solanum junctum has a variable habit and may be an erect or scandent shrub, vine, or even a small tree. The species is unusual in the Torva clade in having flowers with very narrow corolla lobes with sparse interpetalar tissue, but its branched inflorescences and green upright fruits are shared with many other species in this section. Morphologically, the violet to purple flowers with narrow corolla lobes of Solanum junctum are similar to those of Solanum subinerme. Additionally, both species have curved flower buds and slightly zygomorphic flowers due to curved anthers. These species can be differentiated by the larger flowers of Solanum subinerme, with corollas 3.5-4 cm in diameter (versus 2-3 cm in diameter in Solanum junctum), the longer cauline prickles in Solanum subinerme, and presence of long straight prickles on the adaxial leaf surface in Solanum subinerme, which are lacking in Solanum junctum. Finally, Solanum subinerme has thin pedicels that reach 2 cm or more in fruit while those of Solanum junctum are thicker and only reach 14 mm. Solanum subinerme has a much broader distribution and is found from the Caribbean through northern South America to the Amazon Basin. It is not known from the higher elevations of Peru where Solanum junctum is found. Solanum junctum is also similar to Solanum poinsettiifolium, a species ranging from Dept. Beni, Bolivia along the eastern slope of the Andes to central Peru. Solanum poinsettiifolium is represented by numerous collections from the area where Ucayali, Huánuco, and Loreto Departments intersect. These superficially resemble Solanum junctum as they share similar leaf morphology, flowers and fruits that are a similar size and color, and both species have curved flower buds. These species differ in that Solanum poinsettiifolium specimens are all described as trees or shrubs, have very few spines on the stem and none on the abaxial leaf surface, and have dense white tomentum with a soft, velvety appearance on the abaxial leaf surfaces. The corolla of Solanum poinsettiifolium has more abundant interpetalar tissue and the inflorescence is stout and unbranched. Some specimens of Solanum ovalifolium Dunal (another member of the Torva clade) may also resemble Solanum junctum. Solanum ovalifolium is a shrub to small tree with much smaller flowers than Solanum junctum (corollas typically under 1 cm in diameter in Solanum ovalifolium vs. 2-3 cm in diameter in Solanum junctum). The inflorescences of Solanum ovalifolium are generally larger and more branched than those of Solanum junctum and may branch further up the rachis, whereas the inflorescences in Solanum junctum branch very near the base. Solanum ovalifolium ranges from Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador to Depts. Amazonas and Cajamarca in northern Peru, where its distribution appears to terminate at the Amotape-Huancabamba zone (Stern and Bohs 2010). It is also possible to confuse Solanum junctum with Solanum pedemontanum, a member of the Micracantha clade. At least two specimens of Solanum pedemontanum (Krukoff 8421 and McDaniel & Rimachi 16879 at NY) have been annotated as possible Solanum junctum by M. Nee. Macbride (1962) cited specimens belonging to both Solanum junctum and Solanum pedemontanum in his taxonomic treatment of Solanum heterophyllum. While the habit of Solanum junctum ranges from a vine to shrub, Solanum pedemontanum is nearly always described as a scrambling vine. In Peru, Solanum pedemontanum tends to occur at lower elevations (100-450 m) than Solanum junctum (600-1800 m). The corolla in Solanum pedemontanum is white versus the light purple corolla of Solanum junctum and the corolla lobes of Solanum pedemontanum are slightly longer (12-20 mm) than those of Solanum junctum (8-12 mm). The inflorescence in Solanum pedemontanum is unbranched, whereas it branches at the base in Solanum junctum. Finally, fruits in Solanum pedemontanum are orange to red whereas they remain green at maturity in Solanum junctum.

wfo-0001020071,"Capsicum dimorphum is a member of the Andean clade, recovered as sister to C. longifolium. Capsicum dimorphum is variable in the degree of general pubescence, leaf shape and presence or absence of purple or maroon spots on the corolla. It is morphologically most similar to C. longifolium with which it shares short pedicels and similar shape and colour of the corolla, fruit and seeds. Capsicum dimorphum can be distinguished by having usually pubescent vegetative organs and calyces (vs. glabrous), membranous, longer and wider major leaves, flowers that are solitary or up to five per axil (vs. 3–9 flowers on a short rachis) and a calyx without appendages or with three minute appendages (vs. 2–3 winged triangular appendages). Capsicum dimorphum is sympatric with C. geminifolium which is distinguished by having long-acuminate leaves, 2–5 long and thin calyx appendages and campanulate corollas. Populations of C. dimorphum from Peru (Department Pasco) are glabrescent to glabrous plants and the leaves are somewhat coriaceous, but the flowers and fruits match those of the pubescent populations of Colombia and Ecuador."
wfo-0001028294,"Solanum hamulosum and S. dimorphispinum are very similar in habit, habitat, leaf size and prickle shape. They can readily be distinguished on characters of the stellate hairs, but it was not known whether these differences correlated to differences on other organs of the plant. Bean (2004) was able to procure mature fruits of both species; those of S. dimorphispinum are 30-35 mm in diameter, while those of S. hamulosum are only 13-15 mm diameter. This correlation is seen as a vindication for using stellate hair morphology in diagnosing and separating Solanum taxa where there is incomplete data about the flowering or fruiting characters. The hairs are always available for study, and are unaffected by drying or preserving. Many other useful characters are rarely available or visible only on fresh material, or difficult to determine from dried specimens. Symon (1981) observed that S. hamulosum and S. dimorphispinum form a closely related species pair, but they differ substantially in their alkaloid content (Bradley et al., 1978, 1979). "
wfo-0001032523,"Solanum wittei is a rare shrub with entire acuminate leaves, erect inflorescences, and deltate prickles usually visible on young stems. Its stellate trichomes have fewer longer rays than many members of the Giganteum clade and many trichomes are often reduced to a midpoint. Solanum wittei is included within S. tettense by Edmonds (2012). We have chosen to recognize this species as distinct from the undoubtedly closely related S. tettense; it differs from the latter in its concolorous to weakly discolorous leaves (versus strongly discolorous leaves in S. tettense), acuminate leaf apices (versus leaf apices usually acute and finely rounded at the tip in S. tettense), anthers 3.5-4 mm long (versus 4-6 mm long in S. tettense), stem and leaf stellate trichome midpoints elongated to 0.4-1(2) mm (versus midpoints the same length as the rays in S. tettense), and stellate trichomes on the leaves with only 0-12 rays (versus 4-20 rays in S. tettense). The inflorescences of S. wittei are usually longer and bear fewer flowers than those of S. tettense, although due the variability encompassed in S. tettense the inflorescence differences are not clear when measurement ranges for the two species are compared. The boundary between S. wittei and S. tettense in somewhat unclear where the two species may be sympatric. Tanner 1061, Tanner 4928, and Procter 847 have a combination of discolorous leaves, dense inflorescences, and elongated midpoints and have been provisionally placed in S. wittei. We recognize collections from western Uganda as S. tettense with the exception of Thomas 3988 with long midpoints and short anthers which has been placed in S. wittei. The acuminate glabrescent leaves and medium-sized erect inflorescences of S. wittei resemble the bristle-free types of the high montane S. schumannianum. Solanum wittei can be distinguished from S. schumannianum by its deltate stem prickles 2.5-6 mm wide at base (versus no deltate prickles, only thin bristles on S. schumannianum), seeds 2.7-3x2-2.4 mm (versus seeds 3.5-4.5x3-4 mm in S. schumannianum), and occurrence at 1200 - 1900 m elevation (versus 1800-2600 m elevation for S. schumannianum). Solanum wittei and S. schumannianum are not sympatric as S. schumannianum is restricted to the eastern African Arc Mountains in Tanzania and Kenya, outside the distribution range of S. wittei. Solanum wittei is fully sympatric with the widespread S. giganteum ; S. wittei can be distinguished by its leaves 6-10 cm long (versus 12-40 cm long in S. giganteum), 15-30 flowers per inflorescence (versus 30-150 flowers per inflorescence in S. giganteum), and anthers 3.5-4 mm long (versus anthers 2.5-3 mm long in S. giganteum). The smaller individuals of S. wittei somewhat resemble the largely sympatric inland S. cyaneopurpureum, but S. cyaneopurpureum is a smaller plant with yellow leaves on herbarium specimens (versus leaves drying green-brown in S. wittei), smaller unbranched inflorescences with 3-10 flowers (versus inflorescences with primary and secondary branching and 15-30 flowers in S. wittei), and exclusively stellate trichomes with 8 rays or less (versus trichomes with 0-20 rays in S. wittei)."
wfo-0001027585,"Solanum dimorphispinum is one of the few Australian species for which all stellae lack a central ray. The mature fruits are pale yellow and globose and 3-3.5 cm in diameter. Smaller immature fruits (seen in spirit collection) are quite ellipsoidal in shape. Symon (1981) counted 68, 121, and 156 seeds in three different fruits."
wfo-0001032594,"Solanum zuloagae is most similar morphologically to S. huayavillense, with which it is broadly, but not locally, sympatric. The species share large, membranous leaves with ciliate margins, lax stems that zig-zag over other vegetation, small flowers with stubby anthers and small fruits. Solanum zuloagae can be distinguished from S. huayavillense by calyx morphology (tube shorter than lobes versus longer than lobes in S. huayavillense), corolla colour (white versus yellow) and slightly longer (3–3.5 mm long versus 2.5–3 mm long) anthers. Berries of S. zuloagae consistently have eight stone cells of two sizes, while those of S. huayavillense either have four or the stone cells are completely absent."
wfo-0001030611,"Fruits of S. pseudolulo are frequently gathered and eaten in Colombia. The flavor is variable. Some forms are tart and delicious, others rather bland. The fruits are widely held to be inferior to those of the true lulo, S. quitoense; but the two are sometimes sold interchangably in markets. Apparently, S. pseudolulo is never cultivated but is often tolerated as a weed in dooryards and fields, where it is used as a source of fresh fruit. The species should not be neglected by fruit crop breeders. It is surprising that no earlier name than Heiser’s is available for S. pseudolulo. The plant is common in the most populous part of Colombia and should have been noticed by preceding botanists. It is frequently confused with its sympatric relative, S. hirtum, and is largely determined as that species in herbaria. It may be distinguished by the narrower leaves, conspicuously woolly calyx, shorter anthers, and larger fruits with shorter, more readily deciduous trichomes. The apparently simple vestiture of upper leaf-surfaces is also distinctive, though it is duplicated in a few forms of S. hirtum. Note by L. Bohs, 9/2005: Since Whalen et al.’s (1981) monograph was published, S. pseudolulo has been collected in Ecuador. I have collected it twice, once from Puerto Quito (Prov. Pichincha) and once from Isimanchi (Prov. Zamora-Chinchipe). In both cases it was growing as a dooryard plant. It is not known at present if S. pseudolulo grows wild in Ecuador."
wfo-0001031497,"Solanum stramoniifolium is a phylogenetically isolated species within section Lasiocarpa. Its truncate calyx and small, bright red berries, glabrous at maturity, are unique in the group. Within section Lasiocarpa, a distant relationship with S. sessiliflorum might be suggested on the basis of similarity in structure of trichomes on stems and berries. Cauline stellae in both species have reduced midpoints and lateral rays oriented in a horizontal plane. Those of the fruits also have shorter midpoints than are found in other species and have numerous, short lateral rays distributed densely along the trichome stalks. The large, broad-based, sparsely distributed cauline prickles of both species may also reflect a relationship. In many other respects, S. stramoniifolium  and S. sessiliflorum are very different. The latter species bears stellate hairs with elongate midpoints on upper leaf surfaces and has well-developed calyx lobes and large fruits. Solanum stramoniifolium displays a striking pattern of geographical variation. Most specimens from the western Amazon Basin are without prickles (except the earliest growth). Many of the same collections have membranous leaves, sparsely puberulent or glabrous above, and relatively large berries. The distribution of this western race corresponds to the regions in which the species is used and occasionally cultivated by man. The somewhat larger fruits and lack of prickles suggest a history of human selection. Some recent authors have recognized the western race as a species or group of species distinct from S. stramoniifolium (Macbride 1962; Schultes and Romero-Castañeda 1962). Whalen et al. (1981) did not feel that this interpretation is warranted, because distinguishing characters are not entirely correlated in their occurrence, and broad geographic intergradation is observed in some of them. They chose to recognize the races as taxonomic varieties. Note added by Bohs (2006): The correct compound form of the specific epithet is “stramoniifolium.” Thus, alternative spellings such as that in Whalen et al.

wfo-0001031203,"The cocona  is highly variable in fruit size, form and flavor (Pahlen, 1977), and there is abundant evidence that these variations are commonly recognized and named on a local scale by residents of the upper Amazon Basin where the plant is indigenous. Indians of the Río Cenepa in Departamento Amazonas, Peru use four names to refer to locally grown morphs of S. sessiliflorum. Schultes and Romero-Castañeda (1962) have documented the presence of many locally named cultivars in Amazonian Colombia. They believed two of these were sufficiently distinctive to be considered species separate from S. sessiliflorum, and they proposed the names S. alabile and S. georgicum to refer to them. Solanum alabile, from the Putumayo River of Colombia, has very large, globose fruits up to 10 cm in diameter, sweeter and less acidulous than other forms of S. sessiliflorum. The authors conceded that the species status of S. alabile was questionable. We view the plant as an extreme in a spectrum of fruit variation and choose not to accord it nomenclatural recognition. The form does not seem to be consistently distinguishable by any characters other than those of the fruit, and plants with similar large berries occur sporadically elsewhere throughout the range of S. sessiliflorum. Another form, called S. georgicum by Schultes and Romero-Castañeda (var. georgicum here), is of great interest as a possible progenitor of S. sessiliflorum cultivars. The stems and leaves of var. georgicum are prickly, and the berries globose and relatively small, characters that are likely to be ancestral in S. sessiliflorum . Loss of prickles and increase in size and variability of fruits would have been predictable results of human selection upon var. georgicum-like ancestors during the process of domestication. No other characters distinguish var. georgicum from var. sessiliflorum. The two are fully interfertile (Heiser, 1972), and at least one population is known (at Limoncocha, Ecuador) in which the distinguishing characters segregate freely (Heiser, 1971). The var. georgicum is narrowly restricted in distribution, found only in lowlands just east of the Andes in Ecuador and extreme southern Colombia. If the large-fruited, without prickles cultivars of S. sessiliflorum have indeed been derived from var. georgicum, then an origin in that region would be suggested. Schultes and Romero-Castañeda (1962) provided a useful summary of the introduction of the cocona into international horticulture. Apparently, the species was never grown outside the Amazon Basin until 1949, when it was established at the Instituto Interamericano de Ciencias Agricolas in Turrialba, Costa Rica. From Costa Rica, the cocona was soon disseminated to other experiment stations, botanic gardens, and agricultural concerns under the misapplied name, S. hyporhodium. The spread of the species as a domesticate in the Amazon Basin, however, predated the Costa Rica introduction by many years and probably preceded the arrival of European man. Humboldt and Bonpland collected the species in 1800 on the upper Orinoco River, where it was presumably found in association with indian dwellings and where it already had an established indigenous name, tupiru. The ca. 1812 collection that typifies S. sessiliflorum came from Pará, far down the Amazon from the region where the species is native. The plant was very likely in cultivation there then, as it is now, under the name cubiu. It is regrettable that the name S. sessiliflorum must supplant the more widely used S. topiro to refer to the cocona. According to Index Kewensis, both epithets originated in the same Dunal work, the Solanorum Synopsis of 1816, with S. topiro published on an earlier page. In fact, S. sessiliflorum was proposed two years earlier in 1814 in Dunal’s treatment of Solanum for Poiret’s supplement to Lamarck’s Encyclopédie Méthodique. The name was one of several validly published there that were missed in the compilation of Index Kewensis."
wfo-0001026818,"Solanum candidum is similar to S. quitoense, but differs in having denser spines and reddish, persistently hairy fruits with sparse cream or yellowish fruit pulp. Solanum candidum is also similar to S. hirtum. The latter species differs in its smaller leaves and fruits and its sessile and usually gland-tipped stem stellae. Solanum candidum shows a striking clinal pattern of variation in Mexico and Central America. In the northwestern Mexican states of Somora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Nayarit, most plants have relatively inconspicuous pubescence, numerous, fine cauline prickles, long pedicels, large corollas, and short fruit hairs. In Figure 21 of Whalen et al. (1981), variation of these characters in the four northwestern Mexican states is compared with that found in Guatemala and Belize, using measurements taken from herbarium collections. The differences are of magnitude that might justify recognition of distinct taxonomic entities, were the extreme forms not interconnected by a clinal series of intermediate populations. To visualize this cline, data on variation in nine characters was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). The second principal component, which explained 12.3% of the total variance, best expressed the clinal variation in S. candidum. PCA-2 values for individual collections are mapped in Figure 22 of Whalen et al. (1981), showing an overall clinal pattern with extreme forms in the Mexican state of Nayarit and in eastern Guatemala. It is tempting to speculate on the significance of this cline, in that it spans the transition from subtropical to tropical environments, but more complete knowledge is needed of the biological functions of the variable characters. It is not presently possible to suggest whether the cline is primary or the result of secondary contact between divergent population systems. In Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, S. candidum seems to be rather sparsely distributed. Plants of this region resemble those of Guatemala, with conspicuous, woolly, yellowish pubescence, but are set apart by a relative paucity of prickles on stems and leaves.
"
wfo-0001028971,"Solanum lasiocarpum is closely related to the Neotropical S. candidum. The species are so similar that we are not completely at ease retaining them. The smaller prickles, smaller leaves, shorter inflorescences, smaller more sericeous calyces, narrower anthers and smaller fruits that distinguish S. lasiocarpum from S. candidum constitute a long list of differences, but each is quantitative, and in every case, there is some overlap. Until field studies of S. lasiocarpum can be undertaken, the retention of these species is the conservative treatment. If they are combined, the name S. lasiocarpum, based on an Asian type, will have to be applied to the American plants, as well. Solanum lasiocarpum must be of ultimate American origin, and its present distribution presents a puzzling historical problem, as does that of S. repandum. The great variability of S. lasiocarpum and its morphological divergence from its American counterpart make recent human introduction an unsatisfactory explanation. If dispersal was by birds or early man, it is surprising that the species is not found on intervening islands of Oceania. The resurrection of a little known epithet for this species is unfortunate, since the name S. ferox has been consistently applied for over a century. Linnaeus gave no reference to a specimen or plate in his protologues of S. ferox, and typification of that name is still problematical. It is clear, however, that the name does not belong to the species treated here, because Linnaeus described a prickly calyx completely enclosing the berry. More likely the name refers to the plant currently called S. involucratum Blume. The latter interpretation was followed by Dunal and other early nineteenth century authors. Misapplication of the name to the species here called S. lasiocarpum began with Nees in 1837 who was followed by Bentham and Hooker in floristic works (see lists of synonymy). Several recent authors have become aware of this misapplication and have taken up the name S. stramonifolium for S. lasiocarpum. This use of the name S. stramonifolium began with Dunal, who must have been confused by Jacquin’s erroneous citation, “In Indiae Orientalis.” In fact, S. stramonifolium is clearly typified and is a species of northern South America already treated in this monograph. Typification of S. lasiocarpum is straightforward. In Dunal’s 1816 and 1852 works, he cited two specimens, one of which is currently housed at P. However, these specimens had not yet been seen by him at the time of initial publication in 1813 (“v.s. 1814”), and cannot be accepted as types. Dunal’s original concept of the species was based entirely on two pre-Linnaean illustrations (R. Morison, Plantarum Historiae Oxioniensis, sect. 13, tab. 2, Fig. 12 and Rheede, Hortus Indicus Malabaricus 2, tab. 35 ). The Rheede plate has been chosen as lectotype because of its greater clarity and detail. Commentary added by Bohs (9/2005): Molecular phylogenies of section Lasiocarpa remove some of the problems posed by Whalen et al. (1981) for the distribution of S. lasiocarpum. Although trees based on chloroplast vs. nuclear sequence data differ in the relationships hypothesized for some Lasiocarpa species (e.g., S. hirtum), both types of data consistently place the neotropical S. candidum together in a clade with the Asian species S. repandum and S. lasiocarpum (Bohs, 2004; Bohs, unpubl. data). Whalen et al. (1981) state that it is surprising that, given that its ancestor must have been dispersed from the New World, S. lasiocarpum is not found on outlying islands of Oceania. Solanum repandum occupies a more or less intermediate range on these outlying islands, so this problem seems to be solved. However, it still remains to be determined how and when the ancestor of S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum arrived in the South Pacific and how the morphological differences between the two Asian species evolved. Poor resolution and conflicting gene topologies for species of section Lasiocarpa suggest that complex patterns of hybridization and introgression may be involved in many species in the section. Perhaps the same processes have contributed to the confusing morphological character suites seen in S. repandum and S. lasiocarpum. The application of the name S. ferox L. has not been critically examined at this time. According to Heiser (1996), S. ferox is the correct name for the species called S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum in Whalen et al. (1981). More research is needed to clarify the application of this name and to designate a lectotype or neotype for S. ferox L. Heiser recognizes two varieties of S. ferox. Solanum ferox var. ferox includes plants with prickly calyces that completely enclose the fruit. Solanum ferox var. lasiocarpum (Dunal) Miq. includes plants in which the calyx is not spiny and does not enclose the fruit. This latter variety encompasses domesticates as well as possibly wild plants and includes the species recognized as S. lasiocarpum and S. repandum in Whalen et al. (1981). Domesticaed forms lack prickles, have large fruits, and in some cases have both simple and stellate-haired races. These have been called S. ferox var. repandum (G. Forst.) Bitter or recognized as cultivate group Domesticum within S. ferox. See Heiser (1996) and Hasan & Jansen (1994) for details."
wfo-0001429742,"Like Solanum eburneum, Solanum watneyi and Solanum succosum, but differing by having elliptic, unlobed (or rarely very shallowly lobed) leaves, small apical leaves, long calyx lobes on the staminate flowers and fully erect staminate inflorescence branches."
wfo-0001028475,"Solanum huayavillense is unique in the morelloid clade, and unusual in Solanum outside of the tomatoes, in having pale yellow, rather than white or violet, flowers. The yellow of S. huayavillense flowers is paler than that of the tomatoes but still clearly yellow. It is not known whether this yellow is due to carotenoid or flavonoid content, as no chemical analysis has been undertaken. Vegetatively and in fruit S. huayavillense resembles S. zuloagae from slightly lower elevations in Argentina. The two species share lax growth, with long branches scrambling over adjacent vegetation, thin membranous leaves with sparsely ciliate margins and tiny flowers with short, stubby anthers. The flowers of S. huayavillense are slightly smaller than those of S. zuloagae (0.9–1.2 cm in diameter versus 1.2–1.8 cm in diameter) and differ in colour (yellow versus clear white). The calyx tube is longer than the lobes in S. huayavillense and somewhat urceolate, while in S. zuloagae the lobes are longer than the tube, and often unequal in size."
wfo-1000050013,"Averett (1973) included this taxon under his broad concept of C. coronopus, as had earlier workers. Henrickson (by annotation) long treated the taxon as but a variety of C. coronopus, but, presumably, after noting the treatment of his proposed variety as specifically distinct (through annotations by Turner at LL-TEX), he also accepted its present status. Typical C. coronopus occurs largely to the east of C. arida. The two taxa are readily recognized by both vestiture and to some extent by leaf shape. Following Henrickson, and the present author, most of the references to C. coronopus in floristic literature for West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California would now be Chamaesaracha arida."
wfo-0001028444,"Solanum homalospermum is partially sympatric with S. elaeagnifolium and S. mortonii. It is similar to S. elaeagnifolium in its narrowly elliptic or lanceolate leaves, but can be distinguished from that species by its porrect-stellate, rather than lepidote, pubescence and strongly andromonoecious breeding system with a single hermaphroditic flower at the base of the inflorescence. It differs from S. mortonii in its lanceolate, concolorous leaves, porrect-stellate rather than multangulate pubescence, and in its strongly deflexed fruiting pedicel. Solanum homalospermum occurs at (usually) lower elevations and to the east of the main distribution of S. mortonii (see Figs 8 and 12)."
wfo-0001029657,"Solanum mortonii is a striking species with dense greyish silvery pubescence. It is sympatric with S. elaeagnifolium, and differs from that species in its multangulate, rather than lepidote, trichomes, its broader leaves and strongly andromonoecious habit. This species is restricted to very small area in the eastern part of Catamarca province, Argentina. During attempts to germinate seeds in order to perform mitotic chromosome counts number from rootlets, all seeds collected proved to be inviable. This suggests that S. mortonii has some type of reproductive abnormality or that seeds have very time-limited viability."
wfo-0001028489,"Solanum humile is an bushy shrub recognizable by its numerous straight prickles protruding from its branches at 90 angles, moderately sized ovate leaves with 2-3 lobes on each side, and inflorescences with 2-6 flowers. It comprises a range of morphologies and indumentum types. Several groups within S. humile were previously considered to be independent species. Plants identified as S. giftbergense occur in Namaqualand and southern Namibia between 28-31S latitude, and have large prickles 0.8-1 mm long with thick bases protruding from the main stem, flowers 1.2-1.5 cm diameter, broadly ovate leaves, 7-8 rays on leaf trichomes, and an erect habit. Further north are plants identified as S. subrectemunitum, restricted to 26-27S latitude, with fine, thin, shorter prickles, flowers 1-1.3 cm diameter, leaves more than 2 times longer than wide, 4-8 rays on leaf trichomes, and somewhat ascendant habit. Those populations identified as S. rigescentoides are found throughout the west coast of Namibia, between 17-24 latitude, and have plants with abundant prickles that are long but thin, flowers ca. 2 cm in diameter, fruit 1.1-1.3 cm diameter, broadly ovate leaves, no indumentum or 4-7 rays on leaf trichomes, and an erect habit. The northernmost element of this complex usually identified as S. multiglandulosum occurs at latitudes below 19 and extends into Angola; it has some prickles, flowers ca. 1-1.2 mm in diameter, 4-6 rays on abaxial trichomes, and medium size membranous leaves. Kolberg et al. 639 from the Brandberg Mountains does not fit into any of the above; it has long thick stem prickles like S. giftbergense and flowers ca. 2.8 cm diameter. The above taxa are not discrete entities and we agree with Jaeger (1985) who also recognized them as a single, highly variable species. Historically there has been confusion between S. humile and S. rubetorum, as the name S. rigescens Jacquin was widely applied to smaller-leaved South African taxa with straight prickles. The distribution range of S. humile in Namaqualand and further north does not in fact overlap with that of S. rubetorum in southern and eastern South Africa; S. humile can be distinguished from S. rubetorum by its concolorous leaves with shallow simple lobes 0.2-0.5 cm long (versus discolorous deeply dissected leaves usually with at least some secondary lobe development and primary lobes 0.5-2 cm long in S. rubetorum). Solanum humile is sympatric with S. capense and S. catombelense throughout almost all of its distribution range; the southern populations are sympatric with S. burchellii. Solanum humile can be distinguished from S. catombelense by its leaves with 2-4 pairs of primary veins (versus 4-6 pairs in S. catombelense), lobes extending 1/4-1/2 of the distance towards the midvein (versus less than 1/4 of the distance towards the midvein in S. catombelense), and straight prickles 4-13 mm long (versus straight or curved prickles 1-4 mm long in S. catombelense). It can be instantly told apart from S. burchellii by its lobed green to red-brown leaves with lobes 2-5 mm long and sparse indumentum (versus almost entire uniform yellow-green leaves with lobes up to 1.5 mm long and thick indumentum in S. burchellii). Solanum humile can be distinguished from S. capense by its straight prickles 4-13 mm long perpendicular to the stems and leaves (versus curved prickles 3-5 mm long). The two taxa can look strikingly similar, especially the populations of S. humile with long thin leaves between 26-27 latitude originally described as S. subrectemunitum. Solanum humile s. l. with straight prickles has traditionally been kept separate from S. capense s.l. with curved prickles, but there may be a closer relationship than previously suspected."
wfo-0001027050,"Solanum chrysotrichum is relatively uniform in the northern part of its range; it reaches its southern limit in the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, where it seems to be involved in a nearly intractable complex involving possible local endemics (S. pluviale and S. truncatum), other taxa disjunct from the mountains of Colombia (e.g. S. stellatiglandulosum and S. scorpioideum), as well as possible hybridization with an equally difficult lowland complex composed of S. torvum and S. rudepannum. Like S. truncatum, it is a coarse and spiny plant with abundant ferruginous pubescence and occurs at elevations over about 1000 m. However, S. chrysotrichum lacks the glandular pubescence on the inflorescence axes characteristic of S. truncatum. It differs from S. rudepannum and S. torvum in having stellate hairs of the stem with thicker and longer stalks, the plants are more heavily armed with coarse spines, the leaf margins are often more deeply lobed, and the pubescence has a rusty cast. It is likely that this species can hybridize with S. rudepannum and perhaps other members of sect. Torva, but this should be investigated biosystematically. It had formerly been thought that this species ranged into South America and was identical to Solanum hispidum (based on S. stellatum Ruiz & Pav., 1799, non Jacquin, 1789), and the name S. hispidum was applied to this taxon by Standley & Morton (1938), Gentry & Standley (1974), D’Arcy (1973), and Symon (1981). However, S. hispidum has a very much larger, more open inflorescence and is clearly a different species only occurring in South America, although with very similar bristly hispid pubescence."
wfo-0001031793,"Solanum torvoideum is large, conspicuous and frequently collected. It is most similar and probably closely related to the broadly sympatric S. dammerianum from which it is not easily separated. Solanum dammerianum has a sordid and drab appearance (not brightly ferruginous), is more densely pubescent, and the inflorescence, especially in fruit, is more compact than that of S. torvoideum (the cyme branches not somewhat elongated). Solanum torvoideum is usually readily separated from the extremely widespread S. torvum, which has leaves that are more ovate in outline, a drab aspect and more shrubby growth habit, and always has glandular trichomes in the inflorescence. Section Torva, to which this and Solanum dammerianum perhaps belong, has a centre of diversity in Central and South America, so that these two species are of phytogeographical interest. Solanum torvoideum is very similar (but probably not closely related) to the South American species S. asperolanatum, but differs from it in its denser pubescence, smaller ovate-elliptic rather than ovate leaves, and acicular, not broadly flattened, bases of the prickles."
wfo-0001031791,"The most distinguishing character of this species is its pubescence. While the rest of the members of Solanum section Dunaliana have glabrous stems and leaves at maturity, the abaxial surface of the leaves are densely and persistently pubescent in Solanum torricellense, and the stems are densely pubescent with tardily deciduous stellate hairs. Solanum torricellense also has multangulate stellate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaves, a hair type present in no other species of Solanum section Dunaliana. Save for the pubescence Solanum torricellense is a typical member of Solanum section Dunaliana. "
wfo-0001030285,"Solanum peekelii was named for P. Gerhard Peekel (1876-1949), a missionary in New Guinea who spent forty-three years collecting plants in the Bismark Archipelago, primarily on New Ireland, and who prepared a flora of the area. Though Peekel did not consider himself a botanist, he was clearly dedicated to botany. At the outbreak of the Second World War he took measures to preserve his manuscript. Notwithstanding, it suffered from the unfavorable conditions in dugouts and concentration camps; one volume was even pierced by a bullet from an airplane. During the Japanese occupation of New Ireland, Peekel's botanical knowledge saved his life. All whites were brought to a concentration camp where Peekel was the only male not to be killed because the Japanese wanted to take advantage of his botanical knowledge (Peekel, 1984). Peekel's Flora of the Bismarck Archipelago was translated from German into English by Hently and published in 1984 by the Office of Forests, Division of Botany, Lae, Papua New Guinea. Morphologically, Solanum peekelii is quite similar to S. dunalianum from which it differs in robustness, armament, leaf shape, pubescence, flower size, and fruit size. The unity of this species was recognized either at the species or varietal level by a number of workers. Symon (1985) mistakenly treated this species under the name S. torricellense, a species from which S. peekelii differs markedly (See discussion under S. torricellense). According to Peekel (1984), Solanum peekelii is one of the first plants to appear in abandoned gardens. It is or at least was common, and Peekel reported the Pala people used stems from the species to construct graters for taro and yams by binding them crosswise to a grid."
wfo-0001026905,"Solanum catombelense is a common medium sized shrub with inconspicuous flowers. The majority of specimens have a characteristic grey-brown tinge reminiscent of Chenopodiaceae, although some are yellow-green. The species concept accepted here matches that of Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) and includes a fairly heterogeneous assemblage of morphologies: the type of S. catombelense is a spindly plant with small leaves, S. albotomentosum is larger-leaved, robust and hairy, and S. rautanenii has a prickly calyx. Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) considered S. catombelense to be the southern extension of the S. anguivi distribution range, but the two species are largely sympatric. Solanum catombelense is unlike most S. anguivi s.l. with rounded lobes on the leaves, inflorescences with fewer flowers and fruits, and frequent occurrence of curved prickles. Solanum catombelense is partly sympatric with many spiny Solanum species: S. burchellii, S. capense, and S. humile towards the west, S. litoraneum and S. rubetorum towards the east, and S. supinum in inland areas. The yellow-green representatives of S. catombelense with smaller leaves and straight prickles can appear similar to S. burchellii; these can be distinguished from S. burchellii by the ovate to oblong leaves 3-8 cm long (versus elliptic leaves 1.7-4(5) cm long in S. burchellii), corolla 0.9-1.3 cm in diameter (versus 1.5-2.2 cm in diameter in S. burchellii), and anthers 2.5-3.5 mm long (versus 3.5-5.2 mm long in S. burchellii). Solanum catombelense is distinguished from S. capense by its leaves 3-8 cm long (versus 1.5-2.5 cm long in S. capense) that are lobed for less than 1/4 of the distance to the midvein (versus 1/3-2/3 of the distance to the midvein in S. capense). Solanum catombelense is clearly distinct from S. humile by its leaves with 4-6 pairs of primary veins (versus 2-4 pairs of primary veins in S. humile), leaf lobes extending less than 1/4 of the distance towards the midvein (versus 1/4-1/2 of the distance towards the midvein in S. humile), and straight or curved prickles 1-4 mm long (versus straight prickles 4-13 mm long in S. humile). Solanum catombelense differs from S. litoraneum by its chartaceous leaves with 2-4 lobes (versus membranous leaves with 1-2 lobes in S. litoraneum), 5-6 primary veins (versus 2-4 primary veins in S. litoraneum), and inflorescences 1-2.5 cm long with 1-4 flowers (versus inflorescences ca. 3 cm long with 2-14 flowers in S. litoraneum). Solanum rubetorum can be distinguished by its deeply lobed leaves and smaller trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface. The greyish almost entire leaves of S. catombelense in Botswana have been confused with those of almost entire-leaved and mostly without prickles S. supinum; the identity of S. supinum can be established by its single flowers, pentagonal corolla, and spiny calyx with conspicuously elongate lobes.
"
wfo-0001026342,"Solanum artense is most similar to Solanum semisucculentum, however the species differ in a number of ways. Solanum artense is sparsely to densely pubescent on the stems, along the midvein of the leaves adaxially, and sometimes the inflorescence; its leaves are chartaceous and typically have a greater leaf length to width ratio than S. semisucculentum. Also, S. artense is found below 250 m on calcareous soils while S. semisucculentum is typically found at high elevation on lateritic soils."
wfo-0001028896,"Like S. dunalianum Gaudich. but with narrowly elliptic to lanceolate leaves, many-branched inflorescences arising from the middle of the internode, and smaller fruits. Solanum labyrinthinum differs from other members of section Dunaliana (sensu McClelland 2012) in its almost completely glabrous narrowly elliptic or somewhat lanceolate leaves. Like Solanum torricellense Bitter of New Guinea, but unlike the other members of this group (section Dunaliana sensu McClelland 2012), the inflorescence of this species emerges from the middle of the internode. Solanum labyrinthinum differs from S. peekelii with which it has been confused (see below) in its narrow completely glabrous leaves at maturity with distinctive appressed stellate trichomes when young, its fewer principal leaf veins (7–10 versus 10–14) that often dry yellowish, its slightly smaller flowers (ca. 1.2 cm in diameter versus to 1.5 cm in diameter) and fruits, and in its distribution. The stems of S. labyrinthinum are often purplish tinged, and the flowers are darker purple than those of S. peekelii."
wfo-0001026707,"Solanum bumeliifolium is a rare and distinctive endemic with clusters of long narrow yellow-green leaves at branch apices, unusual lepidote indumentum and narrow entire leaves (D'Arcy and Keating 1976; Whalen 1984). Rays of the smaller stellate trichomes on the stems are fused for 1/3/-1/2 of their length but are less fused on larger foliar trichomes. Stem trichomes of S. bumeliifolium are stalked, unlike those of other Madagascan species with lepidote trichomes, S. croatii and S. heinianum, that are sessile. Identification of S. bumeliifolium is unambiguous; it differs from the sympatric S. heinianum by its leaves 3-7 cm (versus 1.5-3(4) cm) long clustered at the apices of terminal branches over 2 cm long (versus leaves restricted to brachyblasts under 2 cm long), petioles 0.5-1 cm (versus 0.3-0.5 cm) long, and anthers 3-4 mm (versus ca. 5 mm) long. Phillipson & Rabesihanaka 3135 has been identified by D'Arcy as a possible hybrid between S. bumeliifolium and S. heinianum but this is more likely to be a broader-leaved specimen of S. bumeliifolium as considerable leaf width variation exist in this species (see above). Solanum bumeliifolium can be distinguished from S. croatii of wetter environments in SE Madagascar by its concolorous yellow-green (versus discolorous grey-green to white-green) leaves 3-7 cm (versus 9-13(20) cm) long, with a decurrent (versus truncate to rounded) base, and anthers 3-4 mm (versus 4.5-5.5 mm) long.

wfo-0001030625,"This species was treated as S. macaoense Dunal in the “Flora of China” (Zhang et al. 1994), however, the type specimen of S. macaoense (Callery 28/29, P00055495) is clearly conspecific with S. torvum, making S. pseudosaponaceum the oldest and correct name for this taxon. Solanum pseudosaponaceum is one of the few Torva clade species occurring outside of the Americas (Aubriot et al. 2016a). It shares with the American members of the clade a shrubby habit, usually branched inflorescences, and hermaphroditic flowers. In common with S. poka, S. peikuoense and S. torvoideum, it has red berries; members of this clade native to the Americas have green to yellowish green mature fruits (e.g., S. chrysotrichum, S. torvum). For characters useful in distinguishing S. pseudosaponaceum from other members of the Torvum clade see descriptions of S. poka and S. torvum."
wfo-0001027506,"Solanum dennekense is a robust shrub with entire ovate pubescent leaves, white stems, hooked prickles on its stems and straight prickles on its leaves, and bright yellow fruits up to 3.5 cm in diameter that dry hard and bony. Most collections are made from weedy and fertile roadside plants only ca. 1 m tall, but in undisturbed open areas these can develop into trees ca. 6 m tall (M.S. Vorontsova, pers. obs.). The sap is aromatic (fide Tanner 4284). Solanum gillettii has been placed under S. arundo by Jaeger (1985) but under S. dennekense by Friis (2006a, 2006b); we agree with the latter opinion. Solanum dennekense and the more common and largely sympatric S. arundo form the Arundo clade (Fig. 3 in Vorontsova et al. 2013), sharing the curved stem and straight leaf spines, tough yellow pericarp, and white stems. Solanum dennekense occupies wetter environments at higher elevations and can be distinguished from S. arundo by its ovate entire (to obscurely lobed) leaves more than 2.5 cm wide (versus elliptic clearly lobed leaves less than 2.5 cm wide in S. arundo), and leaf prickles 2-5 mm long (versus 5-15 mm in S. arundo).
"
wfo-0001028777,"The almost bare thick shiny red-brown branches of S. jubae make the species easy to distinguish from other African Solanum species, but hard to distinguish from abundant Commiphora (Burseraceae) shrubs in the same habitat. Leaves and flowers appear after the rains and abscise shortly afterwards; fruits develop in the dry season and specimens with mature fruits are rare. Label data note that the plant has an unpleasant smell (Somalia, Hemming 2265, K)."
wfo-0001031738,"Solanum thomsonii is an easily recognisable geographically restricted species with numerous small fruits and long indumentum that dries yellowish-orange on herbarium specimens. Its characteristic yellow-green leaves have broadly rounded secondary lobes, yellow venation patterns on the adaxial surface, and white woolly clumps of trichomes on the abaxial surface. It has stout flexible branches with short internodes and few prickles. C.H. Wright (1906) did not consider his S. thomsonii as being closely related to S. aculeastrum and placed the two species far apart in his taxonomic scheme. Bitter (1923) did not have any material of S. thomsonii available and listed it as an unplaced name; he described a new species, S. protodasypogon (here treated in synonymy), with long yellowish hairs and numerous fruits. Jaeger (1985) simplified Bitter's system for S. aculeastrum s. l. and accepted S. thomsonii as a subspecies of S. aculeastrum. In fruit S. thomsonii is easy to distinguish from S. aculeastrum by its 4-10 smaller (1.4-1.7 cm diameter) smooth berries in each infructescence. In absence of fruit identification is more difficult; S. thomsonii has apically rounded leaf lobes (versus obtuse, sometimes rounded leaf lobes in S. aculeastrum), calyces 10-15 mm long with acuminate lobes (versus calyces 3-15 mm long with acute to apiculate lobes in S. aculeastrum), and the combination of leaf color, long indumentum, and more branched inflorescences with more flowers. The long rust-colored (when dry) hairs of S. thomsonii do occur in some representatives of S. aculeastrum, but numerous small round fruit, branched inflorescences, and leaf morphology are unique to S. thomsonii. Solanum thomsonii and S. aculeastrum are not likely to be mistaken for other Solanum species due to their strongly discolorous leaves that are almost white underneath, comparatively large seeds 3.5-5 mm long, and a mixture of porrect and multangulate stellate hairs with 8-16 rays (versus the more usual 6-8 rays in other large-leaved African Solanum species).
"
wfo-0001031116,"Solanum schliebenii is a rare and odd species with multiple branched inflorescences, long soft bristles, and a peculiar indumentum. It has two unique characters not found in any other African Solanum species; soft bristles and collapsed multangulate trichomes. The bristles are long floppy epidermal outgrowths almost certainly homologous to the prickles of many other species and to the erect bristles in S. schumannianum. These bristles consist of the stalk of a stellate trichome that elongates until it develops into a soft white structure 4-7 mm long and 0.4-0.7 mm wide at base, itself densely covered in stellate trichomes. These bristles form a dense covering on most young stems. The stellate trichomes of S. schliebenii are similar to those in other spiny species of Solanum but are structurally weak and flexible. Solanum trichome classification systems (Seithe 1962, 1979; Roe 1971) are based on overall structure and do not account for different levels of structural strength, although trichomes with weak and collapsing walls somewhat similar to those of S. schliebenii are also found in the New World Solanum section Geminata (G. Don) Walp. (e.g., the arachnoid dendritic trichomes of S. maturecalvans Bitter; Knapp 2002c) and New World Solanum section Cernuum Carv. & Sheph. (e.g. the chaffy dendritic trichomes of S. pachimatium Dunal; Carvalho & Machado 1991). Details of the stellae are almost impossible to distinguish because the trichomes are collapsed flat against the epidermis and partly transparent, appearing as a mealy white coating that is soft to the touch on the stems and leaf undersides. On Paulo 39 (K000441558) and Bruce 618 (K000441559, K000441562) the trichomes are so collapsed that identifying their structure is almost impossible; on Harris et al. 5135 (K000441561) and Jannerup & Mhoro 201 (K000441560) the structural integrity of the trichome cells is more clear such that the individual rays protrude from the surface and it is often possible to count them. Solanum schliebenii is most similar to the more widespread S. schumannianum. The two species share large entire leaves clustered towards the tips of younger branches and multiply branched inflorescences. Solanum schliebenii occurs between 1500 and1800 m while S. schumannianum has only been recorded above 1800 m, and it is not clear how close together in space the two species occur. Solanum schliebenii can be easily distinguished from S. schumannianum by its soft white stem bristles 0.4-0.7 mm at base (versus erect rigid purple-black or brown bristles 0.2-0.4 mm wide at base in S. schumannianum), soft collapsed stellate trichomes (versus erect rigid stellate trichomes in S. schumannianum), leaves ca. 2 times longer than wide (versus leaves 2.5-2.3 times longer than wide in S. schumannianum), pedicels 0.3-0.5 mm long in flower and 0.7-0.9 mm long in fruit (versus pedicels 0.6-1 mm long in flower and 1-1.6 mm long in fruit in S. schumannianum), and seeds 2.7-3.2xca. 2.5 mm (versus seeds 3.5-4.5x3-4 mm in S. schumannianum).
"
wfo-0001030353,"Solanum phoxocarpum is sympatric with the closely related S. aculeastrum, and can be distinguished by the unusual cylindrical pointed fruits, subentire leaves on fertile branches, and mauve flowers; the two species frequently grow together in woodland above 2100 m. Solanum aculeastrum has more deeply lobed leaves and abundant prickles, while S. phoxocarpum has entire leaves and fewer prickles.
"
wfo-0001025704,"Solanum aculeastrum is a widespread and variable shrub easy to recognize by its markedly discolorous lobed leaves that are almost white below and by its prominent (often) orange large, downwardly curved prickles. The fruit is frequently compared to lemons: big, almost always single, yellow, round or apiculate to somewhat elongated, with a tendency to develop warts. Warty fruits are most common in Uganda and in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, but also occur sporadically in South African populations.
Solanum aculeastrum as circumscribed by recent authors (e.g. Jaeger, 1985; Gon&ccedil;alves 2005) is here recognized as three species: the widespread and variable S. aculeastrum s. s., S. thomsonii with multiple small fruits from Tanzanian southern highlands, and S. phoxocarpum with markedly pointed fruits. Solanum aculeastrum can be distinguished from S. thomsonii by its 1(-3) fruits 3-5 cm long (versus 4-10 spherical fruits 1.4-1.7 cm long in each infructescence in S. thomsonii), obtuse or sometimes rounded leaf lobes (versus lobes always rounded in S. thomsonii), and calyx 3-15 mm long with acute to apiculate lobes (versus calyx 10-15 mm long with acuminate lobes in S. thomsonii). Solanum aculeastrum can be distinguished from S. phoxocarpum by its lobed, ovate to elliptic leaves 8-15 cm long and 1.5-2 times longer than wide (versus subentire elliptic leaves 6-8 cm long and ca. 2.5 times longer than wide in S. phoxocarpum), globose to elliptic or pyriform fruit less than two times longer than wide (versus pyriform pointed fruits ca. two times longer than wide in S. phoxocarpum)."
wfo-0001028109,"Solanum giganteum is a striking and commonly collected shrubby pioneer species with large discolorous leaves, the presence of small stipule-like leaves on the stems, large bunches of bright red berries, deltate stem prickles and abundant indumentum detaching from the plant as white powder. Stalks of multangulate trichomes on the young stems and leaves elongate and break off so the stellae form loosely attached clumps. This white powdery substance deposits on anything that comes into contact with the plant. A single stem grows upwards until around 2 meters in height before reaching reproductive maturity and starting to branch dichotomously. The stems are hollow, sweetly aromatic, and sapless (Tanzania, Tanner 5782, K) and the habit is generally similar to a widespread roadside Vernonia (Asteraceae) species (M.S. Vorontsova, pers. obs.). Populations of S. giganteum in India tend to have fewer flowers and fruits as well as smaller leaves. Solanum giganteum is clearly different from sympatric species throughout its distribution range except in Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo where it exhibits greater variability and there is a complex transition with S. tettense and S. wittei. Some populations in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo with more slender habit, smaller and more condensed inflorescences, and shorter yellowish indumentum have been variously segregated as S. bequaertii, S. sordidescens, and S. muansense but we have chosen not to maintain these as distinct taxa. Solanum giganteum is sympatric with the smaller and more slender S. wittei in the inland area surrounding Lake Victoria, Lake Albert, Lake Edward, Lake Kivu, and the northern part of Lake Tanganyika; S. giganteum can be distinguished by its leaves 12-40 cm long (versus 6-10 cm long in S. wittei), 30-150 flowers per inflorescence (versus 15-30 flowers per inflorescence in S. wittei), and anthers 2.5-3 mm long (versus anthers 3.5-4 mm long in S. wittei). Solanum giganteum is largely sympatric with S. tettense, which also has strongly discolorous leaves and deltate prickles; S. giganteum can be distinguished by its elliptic leaves 12-40 cm long (versus ovate leaves 4-10(16) cm long in S. tettense), 30-150 flowers per inflorescence (versus 10-30 flowers per inflorescence in S. tettense), and anthers 2.5-3 mm long (versus anthers 4-6 mm long in S. tettense). Solanum tettense generally occurs in drier areas at lower elevations. Solanum giganteum is one of the few African spiny Solanum species to have a long history of cultivation in Europe, most likely due to its unusual appearance as well as its occurrence in South Africa and India (Sims 1817). Solanum giganteum is also one of the three species of spiny Solanum that occur in tropical Africa as well as in India. The other two species, S. forskalii and S. cordatum, are semi-desert species growing in northeastern Africa, Arabia, and South India, but the distribution of S. giganteum appears to be disjunct, with no collections known from Arabia."
wfo-0001026343,"Solanum arundo is a common and distinctive spiny small tree, often associated with human habitation and easy to recognize by the large flat curved prickles on its stem and long straight prickles on its leaves. Collections of S. arundo are commonly annotated as S. diplacanthum in herbarium collections as the earlier name S. arundo was not used by Bitter (1923). Solanum arundo and the largely sympatric S. dennekense form the Arundo clade (Vorontsova et al. 2013), sharing hooked stem and straight leaf prickles, tough yellow pericarp, and white stems. Solanum arundo can be distinguished from S. dennekense by its longer leaf prickles and its elliptic clearly lobed leaves less than 2.5 cm wide, versus ovate entire or only very shallowly lobed leaves more than 2.5 cm wide in S. dennekense.

"
wfo-0001429810,"Solanum peikuoense is a distinctive plant, and unlikely to be confused with any other species in the region. It is a member of the Torva clade (see Aubriot et al. 2016a) and is morphologically similar to other southeast Asian members of the group such as S. poka, S. pseudosaponaceum and S. torvoideum (and the introduced S. torvum). Its shiny, almost glabrous mature leaves and stems distinguish it from any of these species, all of which are densely pubescent. It can be distinguished from the introduced S. torvum in the shiny leaves with acute to acuminate (rather than acute to truncate) apices, and its red or black berries (versus dirty green-yellow in S. torvum); S. peikuoense also lacks the characteristic simple glandular trichomes found in the inflorescence axes of S. torvum. Some collections (e.g., Ku 1752) mention dark purple stems and purple flowers; other gatherings record the flowers as white."
wfo-0001027310,"Solanum croatii is a small tree easily recognisable by its long narrow willow-like discolorous leaves. Prickles have only been seen on collections made from non-reproductive branches. It is the most abundant species of the three rare Madgascar endemic solanums with lepidote indumentum and narrow entire leaves (D'Arcy & Keating 1976; Whalen 1984). Solanum croatii is the largest of these, growing up to 6 m (habit up to 4 m in S. bumeliifolium and S. heinianum) with leaves 9-13(20) cm long (up to 7 cm in S. bumeliifolium and S. heinianum), and is the only member of the group in southeastern Madagascar, its distribution apparently not overlapping with S. bumeliifolium and S. heinianum in southwestern Madagascar. The majority of S. croatii collections we have seen are without prickles, although the armed juvenile representatives are covered with large prominent orange-brown prickles evenly distributed over the stems, petioles, and leaves. Anther surface fissures are short and fairly regular in appearance, sometimes solitary but often covering all visible anther surface; these are also observed on a minority of flowers in S. bumeliifolium and S. heinianum.
"
wfo-0001026790,"Solanum campylacanthum is a familiar species to anyone visiting northeastern or southern Africa, omnipresent in almost any disturbed environment between sea level and 2000 m elevation. A perennial weed flowering and fruiting abundantly throughout the year, it has mauve flowers, large bright yellow fruits, a long taproot, and usually entire leaves that are often quite large. Comparing isolated specimens of S. campylacanthum creates the impression of numerous species and indeed, 84 names have been published and 23 species and 36 infraspecific taxa were recognized by Bitter (1923) within our concept of S. campylacanthum. Observation of the stands of S. campylacanthum growing throughout Africa and comparison of thousands of herbarium specimens reveals that the morphological variation is actually continuous, with similar variants occurring randomly in different parts of the population, e.g. the presence of curved prickles or obtuse leaf lobes is rare but equally likely in Ethiopia, Kenya, or Mozambique. Solanum campylacanthum does not usually reach above 1.5 m in height, but in the forests of upland Kenya it can grow up to 4 m; the surprising extent of the variation in Kenya has been documented by Robinson (1993). The only morphological character consistently varying with geographical distribution is the occurrence of smaller size and smaller, longer, and narrower leaves south of around 20S. These smaller plants with long narrow leaves were variously recognized by Jaeger and Lester as S. panduriforme or S. delagoense. We include these under S. campylacanthum as the morphological cline is continuous with no marked geographical discontinuity from north to south."
wfo-0001026711,"Solanum burchellii is easy to recognize by its uniform, pale yellow, and almost entire leaves. It is morphologically largely uniform across the northern Cape and Namibia. The closest relative of S. burchellii is almost certainly the more southern but allopatric S. tomentosum; the two species are members of a weakly supported polytomy in the Anguivi grade (Vorontsova et al. 2013), along with other South Africa taxa and the Macaronesian endemics S. vespertilio and S. lidii. Solanum burchellii can be distinguished by its uniform yellow-green leaf drying color (versus red-green, pale grey-green or pale yellow-green leaf drying color in S. tomentosum), elliptic (-ovate) almost entire leaves (versus ovate and usually lobed leaves in S. tomentosum), cuneate or sometimes rounded leaf bases (versus basally rounded to cordate leaf bases in S. tomentosum), and leaf and stem trichomes with stalks up to 0.1 mm (versus up to 0.3 mm in S. tomentosum). Solanum burchellii was considered to be a part of S. tomentosum by Wright (1906) but it is a geographically and morphologically coherent entity, an opinion shared with Bitter (1923), Jaeger (1985), and Kolberg (1992). The distributions of the two species do not seem to overlap and no intermediate specimens have been seen. The northern populations of S. burchellii are sympatric with the widespread and variable S. catombelense; the two species can appear similar with the same yellowish drying color, almost entire leaves and lack of prickles. Solanum burchellii differs from S. catombelense by its elliptic leaves 1.7-4(5) cm long (versus ovate to oblong leaves 3-8 cm long in S. catombelense), corolla 1.5-2.2 cm in diameter (versus 0.9-1.3 cm in diameter in S. catombelense), and anthers 3.5-5.2 mm long (versus 2.5-3.5 mm long in S. catombelense). Solanum burchellii is also sympatric with the following more easily distinguishable species: S. capense with curved prickles, S. humile with more deeply dissected leaves, and S. supinum with single flowers, calyx lobes that elongate in fruit, and yellow berries. The filiform prickles and prominent leaf venation of some young S. burchellii plants can be reminiscent of the invasive S. elaeagnifolium from North America but the resemblance is superficial; the prickles of S. elaeagnifolium are red, the leaves are narrower and the flowers are larger.
"
wfo-0001031316,"Solanum somalense is an erect shrub with noticeable mauve to purple zygomorphic flowers and bright orange berries. The four upper anthers are 5-8 mm long on filaments to 1 mm long and the fifth and lowermost anther is 8-11 mm long, gently curved upwards, with a filament to 5 mm long. In herbarium specimens, the almost black pedicels contrast with the densely stellate-pubescent white stem. Solanum somalense represents one of at least four independent occurrences of heterandry in African Solanum with S. cymbalariifolium of Somalia, the eastern African species S. coagulans and S. melastomoides of the Coagulans clade, and the Canary Island endemics S. lidii and S. vespertilio (Anderson et al. 2006, Levin et al. 2006, Bohs et al. 2007). The vegetative and fruiting morphology of S. somalense is deceptively similar to the rotate-flowered S. schimperianum and the two species were often confused after C. H. Wright (1906) cited specimens of S. somalense as S. carense, a synonym of S. schimperianum. When flowering material is available it is obvious that S. schimperianum differs by its pale mauve rotate flowers 1.3-2 cm in diameter and equal anthers 3.5-4.5 mm long, but identifying the two species without flowers is more difficult. Solanum somalense can be distinguished by its erect habit (versus erect to scandent or scrambling in S. schimperianum), bright orange berries (versus orange-red to red berries in S. schimperianum), and larger seeds 3.8-5x3.5-3.8 mm (versus in 2.5-3.8x2-2.8 mm in S. schimperianum). Jaeger's (1985) descriptions state that S. somalense has elliptic leaves while S. schimperianum has ovate leaves but we have not found this to be true; leaves of S. schimperianum are strongly ovate with the widest part of the lamina always in the lower 1/3 of the leaf and usually dry unfolded, while the leaves of S. somalense are also ovate although this is less pronounced and they appear longer as they usually dry folded. Both species occur in northern Somalia but they are not in fact sympatric as S. schimperianum occurs at higher elevations at 1500-2800 m while S. somalense is found at 0-1300 m elevation."
wfo-0001029101,"Solanum linnaeanum is a striking shrub easy to recognize by its deeply divided (pinnatifid) leaves with a characteristic rounded lobing pattern. Coastal populations in northern Africa and around the Mediterreanean are morphologically uniform but greater variation is observed in South Africa; an unusual form with narrow prickle bases and thin leaves has been collected on the Inhaca Island in Mozambique (Mogg 30894, K). It is not clear if S. linnaeanum is introduced in the Mediterreanean or whether this is a true amphitropical distribution. The name S. linnaeanum was established to replace the illegitimate and widely misapplied names S. sodomeum L. and S. hermannii Dunal (the former now a rejected name and the latter illegitimate: see Hepper 1978; Hepper & Jaeger 1986). The name apple of Sodom is an ancient reference to a plant that grew in the ashes of the site of the Biblical city of Sodom. The fruits of this plant looked edible, but when picked they dissolved into smoke and ashes. The name apple of Sodom also refers to Calotropis procera (Aiton) W. T .Aiton in the Apocynaceae, a Middle Eastern plant with large greenish poisonous fruits and fluffy seeds. It is possible the name became attached to S. linnaeanum in pre-Linnaean times due to its spherical, greenish fruits that contain toxic alkaloids. The name Sodom apple was probably corrupted to soda apple, a vernacular name applied to other spiny yellow-fruited Solanum species such as S. viarum (Mullahey et al. 1998). Solanum linnaeanum is closely related to the rare South African endemic S. umtuma and can be distinguished by its deeply lobed usually almost pinnatifid leaves with rounded lobes (versus with apically obtuse to acute lobes in S. umtuma).
"
wfo-0001026242,"Solanum anomalum, one of the few prickly Solanum species endemic to western Africa, is an erect shrub with white stems, white deltate stem prickles, and densely clustered inflorescences appearing umbellate. The majority of collections of S. anomalum are from Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon, but the greatest diversity of trichome morphology and leaf shape is in the southern part of the distribution in Angola. Leaves are subentire to weakly lobed throughout Liberia and Democratic Republic of the Congo but deeper lobing is observed in Angolan collections. Two collections display some characters of S. anguivi but most likely belong to S. anomalum because of their multangulate hairs: J. Gossweiler 4500 (Angola, K), has multiple prickles, apically acute leaf lobes, and ca. 18 rays on its stem trichomes; J. Gossweiler 389 (S. anomalum var. cinerascens) has ca. 15 long rays on its stem trichomes. More collections are needed from Angola to clarify the identity of these specimens. Solanum anomalum is sympatric with the Angolan endemic S. pauperum. It can be distinguished from S. pauperum by its deltate prickles on flowering branches (versus no prickles recorded on any herbarium collections of S. pauperum), lobed leaves with cuneate bases (versus entire leaves with long-attenuate leaf bases in S. pauperum), petiole 1/6-1/4 of the leaf blade length (versus petiole 1/3-2/3 of the leaf blade length in S. pauperum), 10-20 flowers per inflorescence (versus 4-8 flowers per inflorescence in S. pauperum), pedicels 0.4-0.5 cm long (versus 0.8-1.5 cm long in S. pauperum), and white corolla (versus mauve in S. anomalum). Solanum giganteum occasionally occurs in Cameroon and Nigeria and can be distinguished by its stellate trichomes detaching as white powder, the presence of stipule-like small leaves on the stems, its discolorous leaves 12-40 cm long, and 30-150 flowers per inflorescence. Solanum anomalum is also reminiscent of the eastern African S. goetzei that has similar condensed inflorescences and glabrescent elliptic leaves, and also occurs in lowland habitats; S. anomalum can be distinguished by its deltate prickles on most specimens (versus no prickles in S. goetzei), and seeds 2.5-2.8 mm long and 2-2.5 mm wide (versus seeds 3.6-4.8 mm long and 2.8-4 mm wide in S. goetzei)."
wfo-0001028164,"Solanum goetzei is a small shrub with unusually large seeds and fine long-acuminate calyx lobes. There is a sharp contrast in the quantity of indumentum between the white densely stellate-pubescent stems and the dark, almost glabrous leaves. There are 12-20 rays on the multangulate stem trichomes, with the bases of the rays distributed along a 0.1-0.2 mm length of the trichome central axis. Leaf trichomes are porrect with only 4-8 rays, and the trichomes on petioles and bases of young leaves are intermediate between these. Cell outlines on the seed epidermis indicate that individual cells are significantly larger than those in small-seeded species, while the number of cells remains roughly the same. The populations in coastal Kenyan and Tanzania are largely morphologically uniform but collections made in inland parts of Tanzania are somewhat morphologically distinct; Greenway et al. 13319 (K) and Sitoni MSB149 (K) have wider lobed leaves, and Luke et al. 10456 and Bidgood & Keeley 322 have a longer rachis and obtuse calyx lobes. Solanum goetzei is frequently confused with the bristle-free variants of the highland S. schumannianum. Solanum goetzei and S. schumannianum occupy largely the same geographical region of Kenya and Tanzania, have similar shrubby habit, entire leaves, and large seeds 3.5-4.5 mm long. Solanum schumannianum can be distinguished by its greater height of 1.5-3 m (versus 0.5-1 m height of S. goetzei), leaves 2.5-3.5 times longer than wide (versus leaves 2-2.5 times longer than wide in S. goetzei), inflorescence branched more than once, with a peduncle 20-60(100) mm long and rachis 1.5-5(7) cm long (versus not branched or branching once, with a peduncle 3-17 mm long and rachis 0.3-1.5 cm long in S. goetzei), and (5)10-20 rays on each trichome on the leaves (versus 4-8(14) rays on each trichome on the leaves in S. goetzei). These two species are unlikely to be truly sympatric as S. schumannianum only grows above 1800 m in elevation, while S. goetzei has not been recorded any higher than 800 m in elevation. Solanum goetzei resembles two West African members of the Giganteum clade, the Angolan endemic S. pauperum and the more widespread S. anomalum. Solanum goetzei and S. pauperum share plain appearance, lack of prickles, entire leaves with attenuate bases, and similar trichome morphology; S. goetzei can be separated by its peduncle 3-17 mm long (versus peduncle less than 1 mm long in S. pauperum), 8-15 flowers per inflorescence (versus 4-8 flowers per inflorescence in S. pauperum), long-acuminate calyx lobes (versus acute calyx lobes in S. pauperum), petioles 1/6-1/4 as long as the adult leaves (versus petioles 1/3-2/3 as long as the adult leaves in S. pauperum), and seeds 3.6-4.8x2.8-4 mm (versus seeds 2.8-3.5x2.5-3.5 mm in S. pauperum). Solanum goetzei and S. anomalum share a lowland habitat, condensed inflorescences, an glabrescent elliptic leaves; S. goetzei can be distinguished by its without prickles habit (versus deltate prickles on most specimens of S. anomalum) and seeds 3.6-4.8x2.8-4 mm (versus seeds 2.5-2.8x2-2.5 mm in S. anomalum).

wfo-0001029407,"Solanum mauense is a weedy shrub with yellowish, densely hairy entire leaves, numerous small curved yellow prickles, and numerous bright red-orange fruits. This species is easy to recognize and has been accepted in the present circumscription by all treatments published since its discovery (Bitter 1923, Jaeger 1985, Agnew and Agnew 1994, Beentje 1994). Solanum mauense is part of the diverse Anguivi grade, probably closely related to the variable and cosmopolitan S. anguivi found throughout the African highlands.
Solanum mauense can be distinguished from the sympatric S. anguivi by its entire or subentire leaves (versus leaves almost always lobed in S. anguivi), calyx lobes elongating to 4.5-6 mm in fruit (versus calyx lobes elongating to 2.5-5 mm in S. anguivi), and trichomes with stalks 0.15-0.6 mm long (versus trichomes with stalks less than 0.1 mm in S. anguivi). A few intermediates with S. mauense morphology but distinct obtuse or acute leaf lobes are known and these may represent juvenile plants (Greenway & Kanuri 850, Enesambulai Valley, Kenya, K; Tweedie 4196, Cherangani, Kenya, K).
"
wfo-0001026925,"Solanum cerasiferum is a slender prickly herb with long inflorescences and up to 3 long-styled flowers and fruits per infructescence; plants exhibit weaker andromonoecy than other members of the eggplant clade such as S. incanum (Vorontsova et al. 2013). Populations appear to be either glabrescent or moderately stellate-pubescent. Members of the eggplant clade are difficult to distinguish morphologically (Knapp et al. 2013) and it is not clear if populations of S. cerasiferum as recognized here include some plants with hybrid origins. Future study at the population level across Africa will be necessary to unravel this complex group. Solanum cerasiferum has been confused with S. melongena, S. incanum, S. dasyphyllum, as well as S. aethiopicum, and many historical specimens of S. cerasiferum are annotated as S. xanthocarpum (a name applied to many specimens of prickly Solanum, but correctly a synonym of the Asian species S. virginianum L.). Solanum cerasiferum is a less robust plant than S. incanum or S. campylacanthum. Crossing and numerical taxonomy studies (Olet & Bukenya-Ziraba 2001) suggest that S. cerasiferum and S. campylacanthum (as incanum) belong to the same biological species and the only significant morphological difference is the absence of indumentum in S. cerasiferum. Review of large numbers of collections from across central Africa suggests that populations seemingly intermediate between S. cerasiferum and S. campylacanthum with a robust habit and densely stellate-pubescent leaves with acute lobes (segregated by Richard Lester as S. beniense, a name we consider here as a synonym of S. campylacanthum ) are found in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. Glabrous-leaved populations of S. cerasiferum are reminiscent of S. melongena and S. aethiopicum, but with more prickles and deeper-lobed obtuse to acute leaf lobes (versus almost entire leaves with rounded lobes in S. melogena and S. aethiopicum). Solanum cerasiferum is also morphologically similar to S. rigidum from the Cape Verde Islands as well as the South African S. umtuma (see Vorontsova & Knapp 2012; Knapp & Vorontsova 2013), but differs from the former in its shorter calyx lobe and the latter in its less decurrent leaves."
wfo-0001030272,"Solanum pauperum is a modest slender shrub with small leaves on long petioles and comparatively large flowers in few-flowered inflorescences. Mature leaves are almost glabrous and are dark brown on herbarium specimens; indumentum density on the stem is variable but the stem appears lighter colored than the leaves. Solanum pauperum is partly sympatric with the only other member of Giganteum clade in Angola, the widespread West African S. anomalum. Solanum pauperum seems to occupy drier places but the relationship between the two species is unclear due to the paucity of Angolan collections. It differs from S. anomalum by its lack of prickles (versus deltate prickles on flowering branches of S. anomalum), entire leaves with long-attenuate leaf bases (versus leaves usually lobed, with cuneate bases in Angolan populations of S. anomalum), petiole 1/3-2/3 of the leaf blade length (versus petiole 1/6-1/4 of the leaf blade length in S. anomalum), 4-8 flowers per inflorescence (versus 10-20 flowers per inflorescence in S. anomalum), pedicels 0.8-1.5 cm long (versus 0.4-0.5 cm long in S. anomalum), and mauve corolla (versus white corolla in S. anomalum). Monteiro s. n. (Angola, comm. to Kew Jan. 1873) appears to display characters intermediate between S. pauperum and S. anomalum. Solanum pauperum also resembles the eastern African species S. goetzei. The two species share lack of prickles, entire leaves with attenuate bases, and similar trichome morphology. Solanum pauperum can be separated by its peduncle less than 1 mm long (versus peduncle 3-17 mm long in S. goetzei), 4-8 flowers per inflorescence (versus 8-15 flowers per inflorescence in S. goetzei), acute calyx lobes (versus long-acuminate calyx lobes in S. goetzei), petioles 1/3-2/3 as long as the adult leaves (versus petioles 1/6-1/4 as long as the adult leaves in S. goetzei), and seeds 2.8-3.5 mm (versus seeds 3.6-4.8x2.8-4x2.5-3.5 mm in S. goetzei). Jaeger (1985) suggests that S. pauperum may be synonymous with S. goetzei but in our opinion the allopatric occurrence and morphological differences between these species provide sufficient evidence for recognising them as separate taxonomic entities.

wfo-0001028929,"Solanum lamprocarpum is a rare species recognized by its foliaceous oblong calyx lobes with obtuse apices, elliptic or obovate lobed leaves that are reddish brown on herbarium specimens, straight prickles, erect woody flowering pedicels and trichomes with midpoints elongated to 0.7-1 mm long. Jaeger (1985) included S. lamprocarpum within S. zanzibarense, a circumscription not supported by our study (Vorontsova et al., 2013). Solanum lamprocarpum is similar to S. zanzibarense and lies within its distribution range. Confusion is also possible with the morphologically similar S. inaequiradians, S. stipitatostellatum, and S. usaramense. Solanum lamprocarpum has lobed leaves and narrow corolla lobes similar to those of S. zanzibarense, but can be distinguished by its straight prickles (versus usually recurved or hooked stem prickles in S. zanzibarense), calyx lobes 8-10 mm long in fruit (versus calyx 2.5-4 mm long in flowers and fruit of S. zanzibarense), elliptic to obovate leaf shape (versus ovate to lanceolate leaf shape in S. zanzibarense), and trichomes with midpoints 0.7-1 mm long (versus trichomes with reduced midpoints in S. zanzibarense). The 0.7-1 mm trichome midpoints of S. lamprocarpum are almost as long as the 1.5-3 mm trichome midpoints of S. inaequiradians, but S. lamprocarpum can be distinguished by its straight stem prickles (versus hooked stem prickles in S. inaequiradians) and elliptic to obovate leaves (versus ovate leaves in S. inaequiradians). Solanum lamprocarpum differs from S. stipitatostellatum by its elliptic to obovate lobed leaves (versus ovate subentire leaves in S. stipitatostellatum), corolla ca. 1.7 cm in diameter (versus corolla 1.8-3 cm in diameter in S. stipitatostellatum), and trichomes with midpoints 0.7-1 mm long throughout the plant (versus trichomes with reduced midpoints, or midpoints occasionally elongated to 0.7 mm on the young stems in S. stipitatostellatum). Solanum usaramense is easily distinguished from S. lamprocarpum by its small hooked stem prickles and larger corolla.
"
wfo-0001028404,"Solanum hindsianum is similar to the widespread S. elaeagnifolium, but has larger, more pentagonal flowers with a curved style and somewhat dimorphic anthers (although not as dimorphic as those in S. houstonii). Anderson et al. (2007) do not record the anthers of S. hindsianum as dimorphic, nor the flowers as zygomorphic. Solanum hindsianum is sister to S. houstonii (sometimes identified as S. tridynamum) in all molecular analyses to date (Anderson et al. 2007; Stern et al. 2011; Wahlert et al. 2014). Solanum hindsianum can be distinguished from S. houstonii by its less strongly zygomorphic flowers, its usually rounder, smaller leaves and its berries that are not completely enclosed in the accrescent calyx. In areas of sympatry in northwestern Mexico, populations of S. houstonii often have anthers that are purple or purple-tinged, while those of S. hindsianum have not been recorded as other than bright yellow, and populations of S. houstonii in these areas of sympatry often have deeply pinnatifid or lobed leaves (e.g., type of S. azureum)."
wfo-0001030709,"Solanum pyracanthos is a striking ornamental species with prominent orange prickles and dark orange to red venation on the leaves that creates a bright contrast with green leaves, vivid purple flowers and yellow anthers. Solanum pyracanthos attracted the attention of science about 50 years earlier than any other species of Solanum from Madagascar. It was grown from seed at the Paris Botanical Gardens before Lamarck described it in 1794. Attention of the horticultural trade was captured, and the species became widely cultivated. Color illustrations of S. pyracanthos were published by Jacquin (1804) from a plant of unknown origin at the Schoenbrunn Gardens in Austria, by Wendland (as S. runcinatum, 1798) from a plant recorded as originating from India, and by Smith (1804) from a plant cultivated in Britain. It is still widely grown for ornament in the northern hemisphere, often in glasshouses or as a seasonal shrub in more temperate areas. Solanum pyracanthos is a morphologically uniform species unlikely to be confused with another taxon. Its closest relative is most likely S. erythracanthum because of their shared simply lobed leaves and tendency towards reddish indumentum. Solanum pyracanthos is more robust and woody, with mature leaves often resembling those of dandelions (Taraxacum, Asteraceae), and larger fruit than S. erythracanthum. The specific epithet was originally published as pyracanthos, a Greek noun in apposition not correctable to an adjective; the alternative forms pyracanthon and pyracanthum are thus incorrect."
wfo-0001026208,"Solanum anguivi is the second most common and variable species of spiny Solanum in Africa (after S. campylacanthum), and encompasses a great deal of morphological and genetic variation. For many years and in many African floras (see Vorontsova & Knapp 2012) it was known as S. indicum L. (see below). Most representatives of S. anguivi have shallowly lobed leaves with obtuse leaf lobes, straight prickles, short calyx lobes, white flowers, and porrect trichomes with short midpoints. Nevertheless, numerous populations from across Africa exhibit independent occurrences of deeply lobed or subentire leaves, rounded leaf lobes, no prickles, long calyx lobes, mauve flowers, and trichomes with long midpoints. Numerous instances of single morphologically anomalous specimens from different parts of Africa fall within S. anguivi s. l. and it is possible these will be recognized as independent taxa following further research (e.g. the broad-leaved Lythgoe & Evans 592, Ethiopia, K; the small-leaved, few-flowered Gillett 16842, Kenya, EA). The circumscription of S. anguivi is quite variable among existing treatments. Richard Lester's research group worked to identify discontinuities in S. anguivi sensu lato using numerical taxonomy (Ackland 1995, Jones 1995, Dale 1995, Lester and Niakan 1986), crossing studies (Lester and Niakan 1986), enzyme electrophoresis (Lester and Niakan 1986), enzyme etching of seed surface (Ackland 1995, Jones 1995), and statistical analyzes of habitat recorded on herbarium specimens (Dale 1995). No natural discontinuity in its variation was observed. We accept a broad concept of S. anguivi here, that includes S. anguivi s. l. as annotated by Lester, including S. anguivi, S. distichum, and S. keniense as recognized by Jaeger (1985), and also including parts of S. adoense and S. usambarense as recognized by Jaeger (1985). This is roughly equivalent to the concept of S. anguivi used by Friis (2006a), Gon&ccedil;alves (2005), and D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994). Solanum anguivi can be confused with the following partly sympatric African species: S. adoense, S. agnewiorum, S. catombelense, S. macracanthum, S. mauense, S. rubetorum, and S. usambarense. Solanum adoense occurs together with S. anguivi in the mountains of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Sudan above 1700 m elevation and can be distinguished by its 1-6 berries per inflorescence (versus 6-22 berries per inflorescence in S. anguivi), leaf lobes rounded or absent (versus leaf lobes usually obtuse or acute in S. anguivi), and 1-3 pairs of veins on each leaf (versus 4-7 pairs of veins on each leaf in S. anguivi). Solanum catombelense occurs together with S. anguivi fairly rarely, below 1000 m elevation in Angola, South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) considered S. catombelense to be the southern extension of S. anguivi but S. anguivi actually extends further south in KwaZulu-Natal and the difference between the two taxa is more in elevation, with S. catombelense occurring at higher altitudes. Solanum catombelense can be separated from S. anguivi by its inflorescences with 1-2 fruits per infructescence (versus 6-22 fruits per infructescence in S. anguivi) and entire leaf margins or rounded leaf lobes (versus leaf lobes usually obtuse on S. anguivi). Solanum macracanthum is sympatric with S. anguivi above 2100 m elevation in Ethiopia, and can be distinguished by its ripe fruit 9-13 mm in diameter (versus 6-9 mm diameter in S. anguivi), and calyx 7-12 mm long (versus calyx 3-5 mm long in S. anguivi). Solanum mauense largely replaces S. anguivi in the mountainous regions of the Rift Valley; S. mauense can be identified by its entire or subentire leaves (versus leaves almost always lobed in S. anguivi), the calyx lobes elongating to 4.5-6 mm in fruit (versus calyx lobes elongating to 2.5-5 mm in S. anguivi), and trichomes with stalks 0.15-0.6 mm long (versus trichomes with stalks less than 0.1 mm in S. anguivi). Solanum agnewiorum is sympatric with S. anguivi in central Kenya and can be identified by its acute to acuminate leaf lobes (versus leaf lobes usually obtuse in S. anguivi), and fruit 20-25 mm in diameter (versus fruit 6-9 mm in diameter in S. anguivi). Solanum usambarense is sympatric with S. anguivi in the mountains of northern Tanzania and Kenya, and can be distinguished by its inflorescence axis branching more than once (versus inflorescence axes unbranched or branching only once in S. anguivi), and more than 20 flowers per inflorescence (versus 5-22 flowers per inflorescence in S. anguivi). Solanum rubetorum occurs together with S. anguivi in ZwaZulu-Natal and Transvaal (South Africa) and can be distinguished by its anthers 5.5-7 mm long (versus anthers 3.5-5 mm long in S. anguivi). Other superficially similar species in Tanzania and Mozambique include S. lamprocarpum (low elevation species with foliaceous apically obtuse calyx lobes), S. stipitatostellatum (scrambling plant with larger flowers and fruits), and S. zanzibarense (scrambling low elevation plant with more deeply lobed corollas). In western Africa S. anguivi is frequently misidentified as S. anomalum; S. anomalum can be distinguished by its multangulate trichomes with over 10 rays on each trichome (versus 6-8 rays on each porrect trichome in S. anguivi). Cultivated forms of S. anguivi are widespread and placed in S. aethiopicum. Solanum anguivi is maintained as a distinct wild to semicultivated species due to its largely distinct morphology, lack of wild intermediates, and a probable selective pressure against hybrids with S. aethiopicum. We follow the circumscription of Richard Lester and place the without prickles Solanum distichum and its synonyms in S. anguivi. Solanum aethiopicum can be identified and distinguished from S. anguivi by a combination of the following characters: annual herbaceous habit, lack of stellate indumentum, smaller and more entire leaves, 1-2 flowers per inflorescence, short and thick pedicels, more than 5 perianth lobes, ovary enlarged even at anthesis, fruit over 1 cm in diameter and with more than two locules, not detaching easily from the pedicels, immature fruit striped and/or not green when immature, and seeds over 2.5 mm long.
For the last 150 years the name Solanum indicum L. has been applied to African S. anguivi and Asian S. violaceum, and other superficially similar taxa. Due to historical confusion and widespread misapplication the epithet indicum was rejected (Hepper 1978). Richard Lester's laboratory (Roberts 1978, Niakan 1980, Lester and Durrands 1984, Lester and Niakan 1986) used protein electrophoresis, seed surface enzyme digests and crossing studies to show that S. anguivi is a species distinct from the Asian S. violaceum. The distributions of S. violaceum and S. anguivi do not overlap; the closest proximity of the two species is S. violaceum in Mauritius and S. anguivi in Madagascar. Solanum anguivi occurs across a similarly large geographical range as S. violaceum but is considerably more variable. Solanum violaceum can be distinguished from S. anguivi by its mauve to purple corollas 1.3-3 cm diameter (versus white to pale mauve corollas 0.8-1.5 cm diameter in S. anguivi), anthers 4.5-8.5 mm long (versus anthers 3.5-5 mm long in S. anguivi), fruiting pedicels 1.2-1.8 mm long (versus fruiting pedicels 0.8-1.3 mm long in S. anguivi), and petiole 1/5-3/5 of the leaf length (versus petiole 1/6-1/4 of the leaf length in S. anguivi).
"
wfo-0001025835,"Solanum aldabrense is an attractive shrub with ornately lobed yellowish leaves, uniform small recurved prickles, and bright scarlet fruits. Leaf morphology is irregularly dimorphic with deeply lobed leaves on some individuals or on older branches and subentire leaves on other individuals or on young shoots. The fruit colour is consistently cited as bright red except one probably inaccurate citation of orange (S.A. Renvoize 883, South Island, K000441526). Solanum aldabrense is the only native Solanum in Aldabra; the other three species are the introduced S. lycopersicum, S. melongena, and S. americanum. Solanum aldabrense is one of the 43 angiosperm species and varieties endemic to the Aldabras (Fosberg and Renvoize 1980). Bitter (1923) placed S. aldabrense in his series Eoafra, separate from his series Afroindica and S. indicum (the latter roughly equivalent to S. anguivi and S. violaceum). Fosberg and Renvoize (1980) note that it is generally regarded as a distinct species. Fosberg (1978) reduced it to a variety of S. indicum after examining collections from Sri Lanka. Jaeger (1985) reinstated S. aldabrense at species rank and this treatment also recognizes S. aldabrense as a distinct and coherent species. The erect pedicels and rounded leaf lobes of S. aldabrense are similar to S. violaceum, a relationship proposed by Fosberg (1978). The red fruit colour and mostly white flower colour suggest a relationship with S. anguivi in Africa and Madagascar, however, and flora of the Aldabras has closer floristic links with the Mascarenes and African east coast than to Asia, where S. violaceum is native (Fosberg and Renvoize 1980). The easiest way to identify S. aldabrense is by recognising its typical yellow sinuate leaves. It can be distinguished from S. anguivi by its petioles 1/3-3/4 of the leaf length (versus petioles 1/6-1/4 of the leaf length in S. anguivi), 3-7 flowers per inflorescence (versus 5-20 flowers per inflorescence in S. anguivi), and erect fruiting pedicels 1.2-1.8 cm long (versus fruiting pedicels usually curved and pendent at maturity, 0.8-1.3 cm long in S. anguivi). Solanum aldabrense can also be distinguished from S. violaceum by its prickles 1-2.5 mm long (versus prickles 4-10 mm long in S. violaceum), anthers 3.5-4 mm long (versus anthers 4.5-8.5 mm long in S. violaceum), and bright red fruit (versus yellow to orange fruit S. violaceum).
"
wfo-0001031128,"Solanum schumannianum is a common montane understory shrub with entire glabrescent leaves clustered at the tips of its branches and dark-purple or brown bristles on its young stems. The erect glabrous bristles 2.5-10 mm in length immediately attract attention and make identification of this species straightforward - there is only one other species of African Solanum with similar bristles, the unrelated S. setaceum Dammer from dry savanna (the Tanzanian S. schliebenii Dammer has soft white wider bristles covered in indumentum). The distinctive bristles are unfortunately not a universal identification character for S. schumannianum, as many specimens from the southern part of its distribution range (ca. 15% of all S. schumannianum specimens examined) have no bristles anywhere on the plant. The size and distribution of bristles when they are present is also variable, from a few barely noticeable protrusions on the youngest stems to a dense covering on old and young stems with extra bristles on the inflorescences, petioles and midveins. Ripe fruit color has not been confirmed, with herbarium sheet notes stating that the fruit is black, purplish-black, indigo, dull red, or brick red. Reliable information on color is difficult to obtain from herbarium sheet labels made by collectors with a wide variety of language usage, but these descriptions are markedly different from the red and bright red usually noted on specimens of Giganteum clade; field observations are necessary to clarify this character. It may be that fruit color changes through ripening as is the case in other Solanum species (e.g., S. nitidum Ruiz & Pav. of the Dulcamaroid Clade, see Knapp 2013a). Leaves of S. schumannianum are consistently entire with some irregularity in shape; acute lobes to 0.5 cm long are present in Lovett 1565 (Tanzania). Members of the Giganteum clade are thought to be andromonoecious (Whalen 1984) but nevertheless we observed numerous short-styled flowers on Cribb et al. 11341 (Tanzania). Most populations in the southern Tanzanian highlands have stellate hairs with midpoints elongated up to 1 mm, often giving the inflorescences and young shoots a visible hirsute appearance. The plants with elongated midpoints often also lack prickles, although there is no clear correlation between long midpoints, the absence of prickles, and geographical distribution; we have seen specimens with elongated midpoints on some parts and midpoints reduced to glands on other parts. Jaeger (1985) recognized the populations without bristles as var. 1; Edmonds (2012) recognized the populations with long midpoints at the varietal level by making a new combination from S. subulatum. Here we follow Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) in not recognising infraspecific groups within S. schumannianum as the length of midpoints frequently varies within Solanum species, and there is no one consistent distinguishing morphological character visible with the naked eye. The Tanzanian Uluguru Mountains are a center of diversity in African prickly solanums with numerous morphological variants in the Giganteum clade. Solanum schumannianum has not been commonly collected there but nevertheless the greatest morphological diversity within the species occurs in the Ulugurus. Solanum ulugurense is treated in synonymy here, but could potentially be recognized as an distinct species following further field work. Solanum schumannianum is sympatric with the Uluguru Mountain endemic S. schliebenii. The two species share large entire leaves clustered towards the tips of younger branches and multiple branched inflorescences, but S. schumannianum can be easily distinguished from the S. schliebenii by its erect rigid purple-black or brown bristles 0.2-0.4 mm wide at base (versus soft white stem bristles 0.4-0.7 mm at the base in S. schliebenii), erect rigid stellate trichomes (versus soft collapsed stellate trichomes in S. schliebenii), leaves 2.5-2.3 times longer than wide (versus leaves ca. 2 times longer than wide in S. schliebenii), pedicels 0.6-1 mm long in flower and 1-1.6 mm long in fruit (versus pedicels 0.3-0.5 mm long in flower and 0.7-0.9 mm long in fruit in S. schliebenii), and seeds 3.5-4.5 x 3-4 mm (versus seeds 2.7-3.2 x ca. 2.5 mm in S. schliebenii). The bristle-free variants of S. schumannianum are frequently confused with the smaller lowland S. goetzei. Solanum schumannianum and S. goetzei occupy largely the same geographical region of Kenya and Tanzania, have a similar shrubby habit, entire leaves, and large seeds 3.5-4.5 mm long; S. schumannianum can be distinguished by its greater height of 1.5-3 m (versus 0.5-1 m height of S. goetzei), leaves 2.5-3.5 times longer than wide (versus leaves 2-2.5 times longer than wide in S. goetzei), inflorescence branched more than once, with a peduncle 20-60(100) mm long and rachis 1.5-5(7) cm long (versus not branched or branching once, with a peduncle 3-17 mm long and rachis 0.3-1.5 mm long in S. goetzei), and (5)10-20 rays on each trichome on the leaves (versus 4-8(14) rays on each trichome on the leaves in S. goetzei). These two species are unlikely to be truly sympatric as S. schumannianum only grows above 1800 m elevation, while S. goetzei has not been recorded any higher than 800 m elevation."
wfo-0001032259,"Solanum usambarense is a hirsute mountain shrub with dense much-branched inflorescences with many flowers. Solanum usambarense can be distinguished from S. anguivi by its inflorescence axis branching more than once (versus inflorescence axes not branching or branching once in S. anguivi), more than 20 flowers per inflorescence (versus fewer than 20 flowers per inflorescence in S. anguivi), and recurved, visibly hirsute pedicels (versus pedicels recurved or mostly straight with or without visible indumentum in S. anguivi). The two species are sympatric throughout the distribution range of S. usambarense. Spiny solanums related to S. anguivi are spectacularly variable throughout tropical Africa and have been described under multiple names, most of which we now recognize as synonyms of S. anguivi. Plants with forked inflorescences and trichomes with long midpoints occur in many higher altitude populations, but many-branched inflorescences with numerous flowers are clearly associated with plants from the northern Tanzanian and Kenyan mountains. The type collection of Solanum usambarense and similar specimens from the West Usambaras are immediately distinctive, but multiple collections from other Eastern Arc mountains display a continuous range of variation with no identifiable cutoff point between S. usambarense and S. anguivi. Populations in the West Usambaras have more highly branched inflorescences, while populations around Kilimanjaro have smaller, more condensed inflorescences with pubescence of trichomes with longer midpoints throughout the plant. Further information on the boundary between S. usambarense and S. anguivi is impossible to obtain from herbarium sheets that only preserve only a single branch, as it may be that inflorescence branching and flower number varies within individuals and between individuals growing under different environmental conditions. We follow Bitter (1923) and Jaeger (1985) in recognising S. usambarense as a separate species. We take a more narrow view of S. usambaranese than did Jaeger (1985), including primarily the Usambara populations and a few other collections from Kilimanjaro and various mountains in Kenya and Tanzania, but not including any populations outside Tanzania and Kenya. We have placed many specimens annotated as S. usambarense by Richard Lester into the more widespread and variable S. anguivi. Specimens annotated as S. indicum var. grandifrons and S. indicum var. rohrii have fewer than 15 flowers per inflorescence and are also recognized as S. anguivi.
"
wfo-0001032413,"Solanum violaceum is an small shrub with bright purple flowers, yellow to orange fruits held on erect pedicels, and prominent curved venation on its broadly lobed leaves. The leaf lobes are often an easy to recognise oblong shape. Inflorescences on herbarium specimens of S. violaceum dry stretched out with all peduncles straight and spread out flat to either side of the rachis, often almost at right angles to the rachis, whereas specimens of S. anguivi Lam. and S. multiflorum Roth dry with at least some peduncles curved and flowers and fruits overlapping. Fruit colour is recorded interchangeably as yellow or orange throughout the distribution range. Unusually for a such a widespread Solanum species, Solanum violaceum is morphologically fairly uniform. The only region of high variability is Sri Lanka, with at least two morphotypes that may merit recognition as separate taxa. Populations with large dark purple corollas up to 3.2 cm in diameter and subentire leaves occur around 1200 m elevation and have long been noted in local floristic treatments (Hepper 1988; F.N. Hepper 4582, Badulla District, Sri Lanka). Plants with large, deeply lobed, strongly discolorous leaves and long straight prickles have been collected in Ramboda (A.H.G. Alston 448; Gardner s.n.). Outside Sri Lanka morphological outliers are not common, e.g. one collection with branched inflorescences and ca. 30 flowers per inflorescence (L.J.G. van der Maesen 2705, India), one collection with recurved pedicels and scarlet fruits like S. anguivi (J. Fernandes 1265, India), and one collection with leaves resembling S. aldabrense C.H.Wright (A.J.C. Grierson & D.G. Long 2675, Bhutan). Solanum violaceum is sympatric with S. multiflorum in Tamil Nadu, India, S. hovei Dunal in the Indian Western Ghats, and S. deflexicarpum C.Y.Wu & S.C.Huang in Yunnan, China. Solanum multiflorum occurs at higher elevations and can be distinguished by its curved pedicels and stellate trichomes on the mature fruits; S. hovei is easy to separate from S. violaceum by its rhomboid leaves and sharply acute to acuminate leaf lobes; S. deflexicarpum often grows together with S. violaceum (S. Knapp, pers. comm.) and can be distinguished by its sharply curved pedicelsand smaller white flowers."
wfo-0001031723,"Solanum tettense is a common shrub of dry areas recognisable by its strongly discolorous regular ovate leaves and deltate stem prickles. Solanum tettense as circumscribed here follows Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) and includes the more southern S. kwebense as well as S. renschii. Variation is fully continuous in a north to south cline, with the southern populations (S. kwebense) with fewer flowers and white corollas (versus mauve corollas in the northern populations of S. tettense s. s.). Southern populations also have greater trichome diversity: simple trichomes with brown glands at the apices occur quite commonly and are especially prominent on species with little cover of stellate trichomes. Stellate trichomes usually do not bear glands but stellate trichomes with glandular midpoints are sometimes seen, often with multicellular segmented midpoints, and occasionally with gland tips also present on lateral rays. Glandular apices are particularly abundant on the pedicels, petioles, and leaf margins, although they are also present on the young stems and leaf blades. The majority of S. tettense populations seem to consist of erect shrubs although they can be scandent or scrambling up surrounding vegetation. The overall appearance of S. tettense is fairly uniform across most of its distribution range, with the exception of its eastern boundary with S. wittei, and a range of aberrant individuals from southern populations that are pricklier and/or smaller-leaved and/or more glabrous. Our circumscription of S. tettense does not include collections from the inland area surrounding the lakes in Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, southern Uganda, or adjacent northwestern Tanzania, which have been placed in S. wittei. Solanum tettense differs from S. wittei by its strongly discolorous leaves (versus concolorous to weakly discolorous leaves in S. wittei), usually acute and finely rounded leaf tips (versus acuminate leaf tips in S. wittei), anthers 4-6 mm long (versus 3.5-4 mm long in S. wittei), stem and leaf stellate trichome midpoints same length as the rays (versus the midpoints elongated to 0.4-1(2) mm in S. wittei), and stellate trichomes on the leaves with 4-20 rays (versus only 0-12 rays in S. wittei). The inflorescences of S. wittei are longer with the flowers more widely spaced, and have fewer flowers than those of S. tettense, although due the variability encompassed in S. tettense these differences are not clear when measurement ranges for the two species are compared. The boundary between S. wittei and S. tettense in somewhat unclear where the two species may be sympatric in western Uganda and Tanzania. Three Tanzanian collections with a combination of discolorous leaves, dense inflorescences, and elongated midpoints (Tanner 1061, Tanner 4928, and Procter 847) have been provisionally placed in S. wittei. Collections from western Uganda are placed in S. tettense with the exception of Thomas 3988 with long midpoints and short anthers which has been placed in S. wittei. Solanum giganteum is largely sympatric with S. tettense which also has strongly discolorous leaves and deltate prickles; S. giganteum can be distinguished from S. tettense by its elliptic leaves 12-40 cm long (versus ovate leaves 4-10(16)cm long in S. tettense), 30-150 flowers per inflorescence (versus 10-30 flowers per inflorescence in S. tettense), and anthers 2.5-3 mm long (versus anthers 4-6 mm long in S. wittei). Solanum tettense generally occurs in drier areas at lower elevations. The southern populations of S. tettense are sometimes confused with S. catombelense, and can be distinguished from the latter by their entire leaves (versus shallowly lobed to almost entire leaves in S. catombelense), anthers 5-5.5 mm long (versus anthers 2.5-3.5 mm long S. catombelense), and stellate trichomes on the stems with 10-25 lateral rays (versus 6-8 lateral rays in S. catombelense).

wfo-0001029685,"Solanum multiflorum is a robust villous shrub with stout inflorescences, curved pedicels, and multiple yellow fruits on each inflorescence. This species encompasses two distinct morphotypes: the type collection of S. erosum and similar populations from Nilghiri and Coimbatore districts have finely divided leaves with secondary lobing and branched inflorescences, while more southern populations in Didingul and Madurai districts have larger leaves with simple lobes and long erect unbranched inflorescences. Most representatives of Solanum multiflorum have conspicuous long-acuminate calyx lobes. The easily visible trichomes on mature berries have caused it to be mistaken for the pubescent-fruited S. lasiocarpum Dunal. Solanum multiflorum is closely related to the widespread S. violaceum. Solanum multiflorum largely replaces S. violaceum in montane forest regions above 1700 m although the two species are partly sympatric. Solanum multiflorum can be distinguished from S. violaceum by the trichomes on its pericarp persisting into maturity (and visible with the naked eye, versus pericarp always glabrous in S. violaceum), 10-20 fruits per inflorescence (versus 5-14 fruits per inflorescence in S. violaceum), woody recurved pedicels (versus slender straight pedicels in S. violaceum), anthers 3.5-4 mm long (versus anthers 4.5-8.5 mm long in S. violaceum), and trichomes with midpoints 0.7-1.8 mm long (versus trichomes with midpoints less than 1 mm long in S. violaceum). Karyotype analysis suggests that S. multiflorum is distinct from S. violaceum in the lengths of some chromosome arms and the presence of one pair of satellite chromosomes (although only one accession of S. multiflorum was analysed; Krishnappa and Chennaveeraiah 1974). Another related Indian species is S. hovei Dunal, endemic to the Western Ghats (Maharashtra, Goa, and Kerala provinces) to the west and north of S. multiflorum's distribution. Solanum hovei can be easily distinguished by its rhomboid leaves with acuminate lobes and moderate short indumentum; its karyotype includes two pairs of satellite chromosomes (only one accession of S. hovei was analysed; Krishnappa and Chennaveeraiah 1974). Solanum multiflorum bears many similarities to S. usambarense Bitter & Dammer in Tanzanian and Kenyan mountains: both are higher elevation species with large villous leaves, larger inflorescences, and trichomes with elongated midpoints, replacing the lower altitude and fewer-flowered S. violaceum and S. anguivi, respectively. Solanum usambarense can be distinguished from S. multiflorum by its multiply branched inflorescences and short calyx lobes. It is likely that S. multiflorum and S. usambarense were under similar selection pressures in their evolutionary histories.

wfo-0001028337,"Solanum heinianum is a rare coastal shrub with narrow oblong discolorous leaves and leafy short-shoots evenly spaced along the stems. It is one of several southern Madagascan species (S. bumeliifolium, S. croatii) with unusual lepidote indumentum and narrow entire leaves (D'Arcy and Keating, 1976; Whalen, 1984). Rays of the smaller stellate trichomes on the stems are fused for a 1/3/-1/2 of their length but are less fused on the larger leaf trichomes. Solanum heinianum can be distinguished from the sympatric S. bumeliifolium by its leaves 1.5-3(4) cm (versus 3-7 cm) long restricted to short shoots under 2 cm long (versus leaves clustered at the apices of terminal branches over 2 cm long), petioles 0.3-0.5 cm (versus 0.5-1 cm) long, and anthers ca. 5 mm (versus 3-4 mm) long. Solanum heinianum differs from S. croatii in southwestern Madagascar by its leaves 1.5-3(4) cm (versus 9-13(20) cm) long clustered on short shoots (versus evenly distributed along branches) and petioles 0.3-0.5 cm (versus 0.7-2 cm) long.
"
wfo-0001029461,"Solanum melastomoides is an arching shrub with large, violet, zygomorphic flowers. Identification is easy in flower and fruit because one stamen is 4-6 mm longer than the others, and the fruit is filled with black seeds. A group of S. melastomoides specimens from northern Somalia have more deeply lobed leaves, sparser indumentum, and smaller trichomes. Solanum melastomoides and its more widespread weedy relative S. coagulans form the zygomorphic-flowered Coagulans clade with one filament longer than the others and black seeds. Solanum melastomoides can be distinguished from S. coagulans by its without prickles calyx that is the same size in flower and fruit (versus accrescent armed calyx in S. coagulans), the long stamen protruding 4-6 mm further than the others (versus 1.5-2 mm further than the others in S. coagulans), leaves under 5 cm long, entire or with up to 3 lobes on each side (versus mostly over 5 cm long with more than 3 lobes on each side in S. coagulans).

wfo-0001029802,"Solanum nienkui is a weak shrub with deeply stellate flowers and a slightly zygomorphic androecium. It is morphologically similar to S. robinsonii and S. putii, and in the molecular analyses of Aubriot et al. (2016a) resolved as sister to S. putii in a group with S. camranhense that itself was sister to S. cyanocarphium. It differs from S. robinsonii (also found in Vietnam) in its wider, less discolorous leaves, deeply stellate, smaller corolla, and somewhat zygomorphic androecium. Solanum camranhense has similar shaped leaves to those of S. nienkui but is a low creeping plant rather than an upright, spindly shrub."
wfo-0001030881,"Solanum robinsonii is superficially similar to S. putii of Thailand and S. nienkui of Hainan Island, China. The three taxa share a spindly shrubby habit, long, thin anthers and small red berries. Solanum robinsonii can be distinguished from S. putii in its more narrowly elliptic leaves that are more strongly discolorous when dry, and from S. nienkui in its slightly larger corollas (to 2 cm in diameter versus to 1.3 cm in diameter) that are less deeply stellate, and in its longer style (7.5–9 mm long versus 5.5–6 mm long)."
wfo-0001020196,"Capsicum pereirae belongs to the Atlantic Forest clade and is a member of the group of species with white corollas tinged with purple and greenish-yellow spots within, also growing in eastern Brazil (e.g. C. mirabile, C. schottianum, C. hunzikerianum). In some specimens from the Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca, anthocyanin pigmentation of the corolla is paler or, more rarely, the purple spots are lacking completely, a peculiarity also observed in C. schottianum and C. mirabile. Capsicum pereirae also shares with C. schottianum the absence of evident calyx appendages, but the two species can be distinguished by general pubescence (plants glabrous in C. pereirae vs. plants glabrescent to pubescent in C. schottianum), consistency of the leaves (coriaceous vs. membranous) and geniculation of the flowering pedicels (non-geniculate vs. geniculate). Stems and leaves of C. pereirae are glabrous like C. hunzikerianum from which it can be differentiated by the lack of appendages in the calyx, the smaller flowers and the shorter fruiting pedicels. The presence of membranous leaves and calyx with five conspicuous appendages distinguish C. mirabile (Figs 88, 89) from C. pereirae with its coriaceous leaves and lack of appendages."
wfo-0001429794,"Capsicum carassense belongs to the Atlantic Forest clade. This species is morphologically very similar to C. mirabile with which it has been confused in herbaria. Both species share a similar habit, the geniculate pedicels at anthesis, the number of calyx appendages, the shape and colour of the corolla, the colour and pungency of the fruits and the blackish seeds. They can be easily distinguished by the moderate to dense indumentum, the narrowly elliptic to lanceolate major leaves with apex acute to obtuse, the shorter petioles (up to 0.6 cm long), the cream buds with greenish-yellow pigmentation, the longer calyx appendages (up to 5 mm) and the larger corolla (13–20 mm in diameter) in C. carassense, compared to C. mirabile which has sparse pubescence (young stems sometimes glabrous), major leaves elliptic (rarely narrowly elliptic) to ovate with apex acuminate to long-acuminate, longer petioles (up to 2.5 cm), purple or greenish-purple buds, shorter calyx appendages (up to 3 mm) and smaller corolla (9–13 mm in diameter) . "
wfo-0001020214,"Capsicum recurvatum belongs to the Atlantic Forest clade. Its most remarkable character is the calyx which is extremely variable in the number, length, shape and orientation of the appendages; the main appendages are five and each flower also bears 1–5 secondary appendages of different lengths amongst them; appendages are cylindrical or most commonly triangular and laterally compressed, spreading or curved backwards in flowering calyx and strongly recurved in fruiting calyx. The corolla is white with a variable patterning of the greenish-yellow pigmentation within, having a large more or less extended greenish-yellow spot in each lobe (e.g. Hunziker 20230) or two smaller spots separated by a white line (main vein) (e.g. Barboza 5004) or many small spots (e.g. Hunziker 25183) in the base of the lobes and in the throat; completely white corollas have been occasionally observed (e.g. Hunziker 25186). Capsicum recurvatum can be distinguished from C. mirabile in the number and orientation of the appendages (5–10 of varying lengths in C. recurvatum vs. five subequal appendages in C. mirabile), corolla colour (white in C. recurvatum vs. purple with white margins in C. mirabile) and its distribution (C. mirabile does not reach Santa Catarina). In herbaria, it is quite common to find specimens of C. recurvatum identified as C. cornutum from which it differs in its white corollas with greenish-yellow spots (vs. white corollas with purple spots in C. cornutum), the recurved (vs. erect or spreading) calyx appendages and the antrorse (vs. spreading and denser) pubescence."
wfo-0001029728,"Of the three species of sect. Acanthophora with which S. myriacanthum is sympatric, S. acerifolium and S. capsicoides can easily be differentiated by their winged seeds, and S. mammosum has larger blue flowers and larger seeds. Its relationship to the more widespread but not sympatric S. viarum and S. aculeatissimum are discussed under S. viarum. The collections cited here are fairly uniform, but a few are uncomfortably close to S. viarum or S. aculeatissimum. At times the enlarged recurved spines are absent on herbarium specimens and the leaves are thinner and more sharply lobed. These collections could be taken for S. aculeatissimum but they more probably represent shade forms of S. myriacanthum. Two collections of from Guatemala (Williams et al. 40306, Harmon 2029) have puberulent ovaries and should thus key to S. viarum but in other respects they are typical of Central American S. myriacanthum. Since until the 1980's there were no other records of S. viarum from North America except as a waif in Massachussetts, for now I am considering these two collections as aberrant S. myriacanthum. The pre-Columbian range of S. myriacanthum probably did not include Cuba or Louisiana where the species seems to be only tenously established."
wfo-0001026388,"The geography of this species has been discussed previously (Nee, 1979). In Colombia it was first collected in 1922; its native range is without doubt in southeastern South America although here its range has probably expanded since the advent of European agriculture and widespread land clearing. It can be expected to spread in the Andes where there is a superabundance of suitable habitat: weedy pastures, coffee plantations and cutover forest. It was early introduced into European botanical gardens and has remained in cultivation, apparently because of the ease of growth, the frightening proliferation of prickles, and the often shiny and purple stems. Solanum atropurpureum is very similar to such species as S. acerifolium Dunal, and except for the much smaller fruits and seeds, to S. capsicoides Allioni. Most specimens of S. atropurpureum have nearly glabrous, deeply lobed and undulate leaf blades. A key to the species of sect. Acanthophora is presented in Nee (1991)."
wfo-0001032271,"Solanum vagum is morphologically similar and probably closely related to S. pubescens, sharing with that species zygomorphic flowers at anthesis, heteromorphic anthers and shiny berries on erect or slightly pendulous pedicels. Hepper (1987) treated material of S. vagum from Sri Lanka as S. pubescens in the “Revised Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon”. It differs from S. pubescens in its complete lack of glandular pubescence, its narrowly elliptic leaves with attenuate bases and slightly larger, white (rather than violet) flowers. The pubescence of adaxial leaf surfaces of S. vagum is of very sparse sessile stellate trichomes with midpoints usually equal to the rays, and the lamina is clearly visible, while in S. pubescens the lamina of young leaves is obscured by the dense covering of glandular stellate to multangulate stalked trichomes with elongate midpoints. The two species apparently co-occur in southern India, while all specimens we have seen identified as S. pubescens from Sri Lanka are referable to S. vagum."
wfo-0001025688,"This species can be confused with S. atropurpureum but the leaves are much less deeply lobed. The similar S. tenuispinum of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru is scarcely sympatric and has longer pedunculate inflorescences with more flowers, although in other respects they are sometimes difficult to separate. The status of this species in Brazil is problematical; all but four of the collections date from before 1900 and the latest collection is from 1922, despite its wide distribution there. Variation is present on some Brazilian specimens that is rare or absent elsewhere, e.g. leaf lobing or the glossy look of the glabrous upper leaf surface (Riedel 1075; Löfgren 781, 1385; Peckolt 35). The scattered Brazilian collections were previously excluded from S. acerifolium in a discussion of its geography (Nee, 1979), but I am now including them. Most agree perfectly with material from the main range, while none cited here differs in any fundamental characters. The leaf shape of S. acerifolium is so variable that additional shapes are not too surprising. The few atypical collections cannot be equated with any other Brazilian species and in any case would be most closely related to S. acerifolium even if a few of the collections eventually prove to belong to a different species. Very little habitat data can be gleaned from the pre-1900 Brazilian collections, but it presumably has a similar ecology to that elsewhere. The collections from Pernambuco (Swainson s.n.) attributing it to ""catinga woods"" surely does not mean that it inhabits the thorn scrubland with many Cactaceae and terrestrial bromeliads which is the modern concept of ""caatinga"" vegetation of the semiarid interior of the Brazilian Nordeste. A possibility is that the distribution of S. acerifolium is somehow related to coffee production. It is commonly found in and around coffee plantations, both producing and abandoned. It is possible that the Brazilian collections represent sporadic introductions from coffee producing areas of the Andes or Central America. Alternatively, it could be native to Brazil and has become introduced into the rest of its range inadvertently with commerce. In 21 of 93 (22%) labels on which flower color is noted, the flower is said to be white. I suspect this represents laxness on the part of collectors and that the corolla is a rather uniform light yellowish green, perhaps fading to a lighter color as the corolla ages."
wfo-0001028571,"The long linear calyx lobes that enclose the fruit like bars of a jail window, hence the name, are distinctive for this species. The inflorescence is sessile or nearly so and there are relatively few flowers. Eventually it may prove possible to divide S. incarceratum into two subspecies, varieties or forms based on the structure of the hairs on the upper side of the leaf. From the relatively few collections available, the presence of stellae or ""simple"" hairs with vestigial rays at the base only poorly correlates with geography. In Peru and Bolivia stellae are usually absent, but in Buchtien 4025 about 1% of the hairs on the upper surface of the leaf have a few vestigial rays. Collections from the Distrito Federal of Brazil tend to be densely tomentose above with multangulate stellae. Various intermediate conditions can be found elsewhere in Brazil. The pattern of variation might suggest hybridization or introgressive hybridization with a very stellate species from another section in the Planalto of Brazil, but no other characters of the plants from the Distrito Federal differ essentially from those of S. incarceratum elsewhere. In the Brazilian Planalto Solanum incarceratum seems restricted to disturbed forest of the narrow gallery forest along waterways through the cerrado vegetation of this seasonally very dry region; the increased pubescence of the plants from this region may be an adaptation to conditions drier than those in other parts of the range. The species may never have lost the basal rays during the evolution toward simple hairs or the production of the basal rays may have been ""reactivated"". More collections are needed, especially in central Brazil where recent intense collecting from the Distrito Federal has unduly overemphasized an area of the tomentose extreme. I suspect that clinal variation is involved and until more collections and observations are made, I prefer not to create yet another epithet in a genus already heavily burdened with names created without an understanding of the natural variation of the entities involved."
wfo-0001020039,"Capsicum ceratocalyx has been assigned to the Bolivian clade, with C. minutiflorum as its sister species. Capsicum ceratocalyx is a poorly known component of the mid-altitudes of the Bolivian Yungas. It has large coriaceous leaves, a calyx with 3–5 incurved and spreading appendages, yellow corollas and winged fruiting pedicels. The affinities of this species need to be further studied, since new preliminary data, based on genome-wide DNA sequences, suggest this species may form an isolated lineage."
wfo-0001020089,"Capsicum friburgense is a beautiful species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest clade with one of the narrowest ranges in the genus. It stands out from other species of the genus in its combination of a distinctive, campanulate-urceolate, entirely pink or lilac corollas with recurved lobes at anthesis and fruiting pedicels up to 65 mm long, the longest of all the Brazilian species. Capsicum friburgense is sympatric in Nova Friburgo (Rio de Janeiro) with C. mirabile; both species have a calyx with five appendages and geniculate pedicels and they have similar colour and morphology of fruit and seeds. Capsicum friburgense differs from C. mirabile in having one or two flowers per node, campanulate-urceolate corollas without spots and fruiting pedicels up to 65 mm long (vs. 2–5 flowers per node, multi-coloured stellate corollas and fruiting pedicels up to 32 mm long in C. mirabile)."
wfo-0001020020,"Capsicum baccatum var. umbilicatum belongs to the Baccatum clade. Amongst the broad morphological variation of the fruits within the domesticated C. baccatum, this cultigen was described from eastern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro), based on its noteworthy and unusual morphotype, consisting in a campanulate-umbilicate, red or orange-red, pendent fruit, the character on which the original description was based. The campanulate-umbilicate shape refers to the fruit having an apex with an acute protrusion arising from a central depression at the middle height of the fruit. Due to this unusual fruit shape and bright red colour, this plant has been repeatedly discussed in the chili pepper literature. "
wfo-0001020219,"Capsicum schottianum is a member of the Atlantic Forest clade. Its most conspicuous feature is the white corollas with a variable quantity of purple and greenish-yellow pigmentation within. The purple (or brownish) pigmentation develops as two large strong spots in the basal half of each lobe extending up to near the apex; in some cases, these spots are not equally developed on each lobe and are more or less diffuse or even lacking. Variation in the anthocyanin pigmentation was observed in flowers of the same individual and within individuals of the same population (e.g. Ubatuba-São Paulo: Barboza et al. 5014, 5015, 5017). Corollas without any sign of purple colour were observed in some populations in Serra do Paranapiacaba (São Paulo). The other distinctive character for this species is the flowering calyx with very prominent main veins that lacks appendages or that has five minute appendages (not more than 0.35 mm long), giving a pentagonal outline to the calyx. Capsicum schottianum is extremely difficult to distinguish from C. campylopodium in herbaria when the specimens have only immature fruits and there is no any indication of the corolla colour in the labels. The calyx of C. schottianum is generally pentagonal in outline and measures 1.5–2.4 mm long, corollas reach 7–10 mm long and 8–14 mm in diameter and have generally purple and greenish-yellow colouration within, the filaments are equal and the berry is globose to subglobose with 6–23 seeds. In contrast, the calyx of C. campylopodium is always circular in outline and measures (1–) 1.2–1.6 mm long, corollas reach 4.5–6.5 (–8) mm long, (6–) 6.4–7.5 (–11) mm in diameter and has golden yellow or ochraceous spots within, the filaments are unequal (3 + 2) and the berry is globose-depressed with only four (very rare six) seeds. Capsicum schottianum can also be confused with C. pereirae which has a similar pattern of colouration in the corolla and calyx shape, but differs in the geniculation of the pedicels (geniculate in C. schottianum vs. non-geniculate in C. pereirae) and leaf morphology (membranous and opaque in C. schottianum vs. coriaceous and shiny in C. pereirae)."
wfo-0001020188,"Capsicum parvifolium belongs to the Caatinga clade. Together with C. longidentatum and C. caatingae, these are the only Capsicum species growing in the arid Brazilian Caatinga (although C. parvifolium also extends into northernmost Venezuela and Colombia). The close affinity between C. parvifolium and C. caatingae was discussed and supported by morphological and karyological data. Capsicum parvifolium resembles C. caatingae; nevertheless, it is clearly distinguishable by the five calyx appendages (vs. absence of appendages in C. caatingae), the few-flowered (vs. multi-flowered) inflorescences, the greenish-golden yellow (vs. red) fruits and the brownish-black (vs. yellow) seeds. Specimens of C. parvifolium from Venezuela have been confused in herbaria with C. rhomboideum, due to their similarities in calyx structure. However, they can be easily differentiated by corolla shape and colour (campanulate and yellow in C. rhomboideum) and fruit colour at maturity (red in C. rhomboideum)."
wfo-1000020807,"Capsicum piuranum belongs to the Andean clade. It is morphologically most similar to C. caballeroi of the Bolivian yungas (Santa Cruz and Cochabamba Departments), based on their campanulate yellow corollas, but they can be easily distinguished. Capsicum piuranum has a purple or greenish-purple calyx with five equal subulate appendages, corolla lobes spreading, smaller fruits (up to 12 mm in diameter), orange to red and non-pungent, pericarp with two stone cells and dark brown to black smaller seeds. In contrast, C. caballeroi has a green calyx with 10 unequal linear appendages, corolla lobes recurved, larger fruits (up to 16 mm), bright red and pungent, stone cells absent and larger seeds pale yellow or nearly white. The species are not sympatric. Capsicum piuranum is sympatric with other two Andean species, C. geminifolium and C. rhomboideum, both of which also have yellow corollas and non-pungent fruits, but a moderate to dense pubescence on stems and leaves. Capsicum geminifolium differs in having longer calyx appendages (3–6.5 mm long) compared to C. piuranum (2.5–3 mm long) and campanulate generally purple spotted yellow corollas (tubular-campanulate and entirely pure yellow in C. piuranum). Capsicum rhomboideum has ovate to rhomboid-ovate leaves, up to 13 axillary flowers, campanulate or campanulate-rotate smaller corollas (5–10 mm long) and smaller (up to 9 mm in diameter) bright red to dark burgundy fruits in contrast to C. piuranum, in which leaves are elliptic (sometimes the minor leaves are ovate), the flowers are solitary or up to three, the corolla is tubular-campanulate and longer (14.5–17 mm long) and the orange to red fruits are larger (9–12 mm in diameter). "
wfo-0001020028,"Capsicum caballeroi belongs to the Bolivian clade. It is easily distinguishable from any other Bolivian species in its calyx with 10 unequal appendages, its yellow tubular-campanulate pendent corollas, its long flowering and fruiting pedicels and its large, bright red fruits and pale seeds. Capsicum caballeroi is morphologically most similar to C. piuranum, an endemic species from northern Peru and can be distinguished from that species in its calyx (green calyx with 10 unequal linear appendages vs. purple or greenish-purple calyx with five equal subulate appendages), its corolla lobes (recurved vs. spreading) and its fruits and seeds (red pungent fruits with pale yellow or nearly white seeds vs. orange to red non-pungent fruits with dark brown to black seeds). The fruits and the seeds of C. caballeroi are larger than those of C. piuranum. Capsicum caballeroi is sympatric with C. minutiflorum; they share yellow corollas and red fruits, but are distinguished by the coriaceous leaves, calyx with 10 unequal appendages, campanulate and larger corollas (10–14 mm long) and fruits (9–16 mm in diameter) of C. caballeroi vs. the membranous leaves, calyx with five equal or subequal appendages, stellate, smaller corollas (6.5–8.5 mm long) and fruits (7–10 mm in diameter) of C. minutiflorum."
wfo-0001020018,"Capsicum baccatum var. pendulum is a member of the Baccatum clade. Morphologically, the corollas are similar in shape and colour to those of its wild progenitor, but they are larger, reaching 20 mm in diameter at anthesis; more consistent differences are the position of the fruiting pedicels and fruits (pendent), fruits that vary in size, shape and colour, the number of seeds (up to 80 per fruit) and the larger seeds (3–5.2 mm long, 3–4 mm wide). The presence of heterostylous flowers is more frequent in var. pendulum than in var. baccatum. This is an uncommon character within Capsicum that has been observed in both domesticated and wild species (C. benoistii and C. tovarii)."
wfo-0001020017,"Capsicum baccatum var. baccatum is a member of the Baccatum clade and is related to C. rabenii and C. chacoense. This entity is considered to be the wild progenitor of the cultivated C. baccatum var. pendulum and is widespread in South America. Its main centre of domestication is thought to be in the Bolivian Amazonia and inter-Andean valleys. Capsicum baccatum var. baccatum typically exhibits 2–3 flowers per node, rarely solitary flowers, geniculate pedicels that are erect or declining at anthesis, 5-merous flowers with white rotate or rotate-stellate corollas with greenish-yellow spots, dimorphic styles and small, globose, subglobose or ellipsoid, erect, deciduous, red fruits. The domesticated genetic lines mainly differ in having larger, 5–8-merous flowers, an ovary with 2–5 locules, quite diverse fruits that vary in size, colour (green, yellow, brown, orange, red) and shape (pendent, usually elongate or of different forms) and larger seeds."
wfo-0001020212,"Capsicum rabenii is a member of the Baccatum clade (Carrizo García et al. 2016, as C. praetermissum). The species has a wide distribution in Brazil where it is mostly known as ‘pimenta comari’ or “Cumari” (as are also C. baccatum, C. chacoense and C. flexuosum) in allusion to its pungent red fruits. It grows spontaneously in many areas but can also be found semi-domesticated and under cultivation in small gardens or in larger scale in farms for commercial use. In Paraguay, this species is less common and the fruits appear to be not so appreciated and consumed as in Brazil. Flowering and fruiting specimens of C. rabenii are very similar to C. baccatum var. baccatum on herbarium specimens, it sometimes being impossible to distinguish one from another if there are no annotations of corolla colour or if specimens are only in fruit. Both species have long petiolate leaves, rotate or rotate-stellate corollas, orange to red globose or elliptic upright fruits and pale yellow seeds. Capsicum rabenii is distinguished, however, not only for its purple-margined corollas, but also for the dense woolly pubescence of the leaves abaxially with spreading trichomes along the main veins and a conspicuous tuft of trichomes in the vein axils; these features distinguish C. rabenii from C. baccatum var. baccatum that lacks anthocyanin pigmentation in the corollas and has usually glabrescent leaves. Only one individual of C. rabenii has been found with completely white corollas in São Paulo State (Brazil, Hunziker 19564) growing in the same environmental conditions with other specimens with purple-margined corollas; this lack of pigmentation may be due to a recessive gene. Similarly, some specimens from Goias State (Brazil) lack dense pubescence along the veins but the tuft of trichomes on the secondary vein axils and the typical corollas with the purple band at the margins are present in these populations. Capsicum rabenii differs from C. chacoense, with which is sympatric in Paraguay, in its rotate, coloured corollas and the characteristic pubescence of the leaves beneath, while C. chacoense has stellate, entirely white corollas and a variable pubescence, but is never woolly."
wfo-0001020174,"Capsicum mirabile is an enigmatic and morphologically variable species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest clade and its interspecific relationships are still not well understood. Capsicum mirabile is characterised by shrubby habit with dichotomous branching, glabrous or glabrescent pubescence, short petioles, elliptic to ovate leaves, few flowers (2–7) per node, five short to long calyx appendages, purple corolla with white margin and yellowish-green or yellowish-white centre and greenish-golden yellow fruits. The distinctive corolla spots of this species were not mentioned in the protologue (Martius 1846), although the other diagnostic characters were clearly stated; this may have introduced confusion into the understanding of this species. Variations in some of the morphological features have been observed in the field, such as the length of the calyx appendages, which can range from very short (< 1 mm long, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais States) to longer (up to 3 mm, São Paulo and Minas Gerais States) and the shape of the leaves (usually elliptic, but also ovate). The most variable trait is the extent and intensity of tones of the reddish-brown spots in the corolla, covering partially or almost completely the lobes within. Variation in the corolla colour has also been observed in specimens in cultivation at the Federal University of Viçosa (seeds from Espírito Santo). Each corolla lobe had a unique purplish spot in some specimens (Hunziker 25235) or two intense purple spots (Hunziker 25243) or the spots were scarcely purple or nearly lacking all together (Hunziker 25236). Capsicum mirabile is sympatric with C. friburgense near the top of Cerro Calêdonia (Nova Friburgo, Rio de Janeiro) where the latter is endemic. Both species share geniculate pedicels, a calyx with five appendages, greenish-golden yellow fruits and blackish-brown or black seeds. They are easily told apart by the shape and colour of the corolla (stellate and multi-coloured in C. mirabile vs. campanulate-urceolate and entirely lilac or pink in C. friburgense) and the leaf shape (elliptic to ovate in C. mirabile vs. ovate in C. friburgense). The two species similar to C. mirabile are C. villosum and C. muticum. The main difference amongst the three species is the pubescence, since C. mirabile is almost completely glabrous (or sparsely pubescent) and the other two species are densely pubescent on stems, leaves, pedicels and calyx. Capsicum villosum has five calyx appendages (as C. mirabile), but the corolla is smaller and the lobes are more white than purple and the greenish-yellow centre is more extensive in comparison with C. mirabile. Capsicum muticum lacks calyx appendages and the purple pigmentation is very scarce, as lines or small spots bordering the greenish-yellow centre of the corolla."
wfo-1000050012,"Capsicum muticum is a member of the Atlantic Forest clade. Capsicum villosum and C. muticum are densely pubescent shrubs with long, spreading, flexuous, eglandular trichomes, geniculate flowering pedicels and stellate corollas; it is also likely that C. muticum has the same greenish-golden yellow mature fruits and brownish-black seeds (mature fruits were not found in field explorations) as C. villosum. Capsicum muticum is distinguished by having a truncate calyx without appendages or with five minute appendages (not more than 0.2 mm long) delimiting a 5-angular calyx and white corolla with a predominantly greenish-yellow centre; in contrast, C. villosum has a calyx with five well-developed linear to subulate appendages (0.3–2.5 mm long) and a white corolla with predominantly purple pigmentation on the lobes and throat."
wfo-0001020257,"Capsicum villosum is a hairy species of the Atlantic Forest clade. This species has dense pubescence, easily visible to the naked eye on all organs of the plant, geniculate pedicels, calyx with five appendages, corolla with various degrees of purple pigmentation within, filaments much longer than anthers, greenish-golden yellow pungent fruits and brownish-black to black seeds. The density and type of pubescence on C. villosum is highlighted in the specific epithet. Capsicum cornutum, C. muticum and C. rabenii are also variable in pubescence density. Capsicum villosum can be distinguished for these other pubescent species mainly by corolla colour or size and calyx appendages. Capsicum villosum and C. rabenii have five subequal calyx appendages and similar corolla size, but the corolla of C. villosum has intense purple spots inside, while in C. rabenii, the corolla is only purple or lilac on the margins. Capsicum cornutum has a larger corolla than C. villosum and up to 10 unequal calyx appendages, while C. muticum lacks calyx appendages and has no intense purple colouration within the corolla. Capsicum villosum can be differentiated from C. mirabile by the dense pubescence and smaller corolla (7–9 mm long) in C. villosum vs. plants glabrescent to glabrous and larger corollas (6–12 mm long) in C. mirabile."
wfo-0001020062,"Capsicum cornutum is a member of the Atlantic Forest clade. It is rarely collected, but easily recognised by its dense pubescence, usually 7–10 unequal calyx appendages and white, stellate corollas with purple and yellowish-green spots abaxially and intense small purple or brownish-red spots adaxially. Some specimens from the State of Rio de Janeiro (Paraty) lack the typical dense pubescence. Capsicum villosum is superficially similar to C. cornutum in its pubescence, geniculate pedicels and corolla and fruit colour, but differs in having five subequal calyx appendages, a smaller corolla (7–9 mm long, 14–14.5 mm in diameter vs. 8–14 mm long, 18–22 mm in diameter in C. cornutum), a different design of purple pigmentation in the corolla lobes and throat (two large spots at the base of each lobe forming a more or less ring-like purple centre within the corolla vs. many small purple or reddish-brown spots amongst the veins in C. cornutum) and filaments 1.6–2.4 longer than the anthers (vs. filaments somewhat longer than the anthers in C. cornutum). Capsicum cornutum has also been confused in herbaria with another species of the Atlantic Forest clade, C. recurvatum. Capsicum cornutum differs in having dense pubescence of long spreading trichomes, longer and erect or spreading calyx appendages and purple pigmentation within the corolla; C. recurvatum is much less pubescent with shorter antrorse trichomes, has shorter and recurved calyx appendages and has a corolla with greenish-yellow spots within and no purple pigmentation. Capsicum cornutum is sympatric, but cannot be confused, with C. schottianum. The presence of calyx appendages, long trichomes and a larger corolla distinguish C. cornutum from C. schottianum."
wfo-0001020081,"Capsicum eximium is a member of the Purple corolla clade. New preliminary evidence on the affinities of species in this clade is discussed under C. pubescens. Capsicum eximium is the most widespread ‘ulupica’ with corolla colour as its most variable character. Eshbaugh (1982) pointed out that, within the same population, he could observe individuals with white, cream or purple corollas; he also associated this variation with the distribution of the species, indicating that the forms with white corollas were restricted to the northern part of its range while populations with purple corollas occurred in southern Bolivia (Tarija). Data from modern collections reinforce that there is high inter- and intrapopulation variability in corolla colour (e.g. Nee 37575, Barboza et al. 4895 & 4896); this deserves further field studies to better understand if populations with white corollas (as stated in many herbaria labels, for example, Vargas C. 36 & 816, Cárdenas 4237, Saravia Toledo 12126, Wood 20218) refer to entirely white corollas or white corollas with greenish-yellow centres (e.g. Mendoza 801, Novara 8346, Barboza 4914)."
wfo-0001020034,"Capsicum cardenasii is resolved within the Purple corolla clade. More recent preliminary phylogenetic evidence showed that C. pubescens is sister to this clade, thus circumscription of these taxa is under revision (CCG, pers. obs.; see under C. pubescens description). The fruits of C. cardenasii are very similar to those of C. eximium and C. eshbaughii, both also known as “ulupica”. The three species can be differentiated by their general pubescence and corollas. Capsicum eshbaughii has a dense pubescence of long furcate glandular trichomes and stellate white corollas with greenish-yellow spots around the throat (rarely purple lines in the lobes). In contrast, C. cardenasii and C. eximium have sparse to moderate pubescence of eglandular simple trichomes and minute simple glandular trichomes. In addition, C. cardenasii has lilac to purple, broadly campanulate corollas, while C. eximium has mostly purple, lilac or magenta, stellate corollas with greenish-yellow pigmentation within."
wfo-0001020140,"Capsicum lanceolatum is a member of the Andean clade. It is an uncommon Mexican and Central American species that can be distinguished from all other Capsicum species by its long pedicels, solitary and large flowers, campanulate white-purple corollas, relatively large fruits (up to 13 mm diameter), non-pungent fruits and long, strongly reflexed fruiting calyx appendages. The other wild Capsicum species of the Andean clade that partially overlaps in distribution with C. lanceolatum is C. rhomboideum; this latter species is found in more disturbed areas. Capsicum lanceolatum differs from C. rhomboideum by having less vigorous habit, mostly glabrous (vs. densely pubescent) plant body, solitary flowers (vs. many-flowered inflorescences), white-purple corollas (vs. yellow) and larger fruits (berries 7–13 mm vs. 5–9 mm in diameter in C. rhomboideum)."
wfo-0001020080,"Capsicum eshbaughii was assigned to the Purple corolla clade. This is a poorly known species from not more than 10 collections, the majority of them in fruit. Capsicum eshbaughii can be distinguished from other species by its combination of dense, glandular pubescence covering the vegetative organs, pedicels and calyx, the presence of (5–) 10 (–12) linear unequal calyx appendages and the lack of purple pigmentation in the corollas (usually). The indumentum consists of different types of glandular trichomes: long simple trichomes with multicellular stalks and unicellular stipitate or not stipitate heads are the most common; short trichomes with bicellular stalks and multicellular heads appear in the calyx and are rare; and furcate trichomes with both branches ending in a unicellular head or one eglandular branch and the other longer and glandular are also common. Eglandular simple or furcate trichomes also appear sparsely intermixed amongst the glandular trichomes."
wfo-0001020108,"Capsicum geminifolium is a member of the Andean clade. It is recognised by its 2–5 somewhat fleshy calyx appendages and yellow corollas that may or may not have maroon or purple spots. It is commonly confused with the partially sympatric species C. lycianthoides, both in herbaria and literature. The long flowering pedicels (15–27 mm), campanulate (stellate in outline) corollas, membranous elliptic or narrowly elliptic leaves and general pubescence distinguish C. geminifolium from C. lycianthoides, which usually has shorter pedicels (8–15 mm), broadly campanulate (pentagonal in outline) corollas, large ovate to broadly ovate coriaceous leaves and is glabrous or very sparsely pubescent."
wfo-0001030658,"Solanum pubescens is morphologically similar and probably closely related to S. vagum, sharing with that species zygomorphic flowers at anthesis, heteromorphic anthers and shiny berries on erect or slightly pendulous pedicels. Hepper (1987) treated material of S. vagum from Sri Lanka as S. pubescens in the “Revised Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon”. Solanum pubescens differs from S. vagum in its glandular pubescence, its narrowly elliptic leaves with attenuate bases and slightly smaller, violet (rather than white) flowers. In S. pubescens the lamina of young leaves is obscured by the dense covering of glandular stellate to multangulate stalked trichomes with elongate midpoints and the leaves are described as “oily to touch” (Singh 1988), while in S. vagum the pubescence of adaxial leaf surfaces is of very sparse sessile stellate trichomes with midpoints usually equal to the rays, and the lamina is clearly visible. The two species are sympatric in southern India."
wfo-0001341734,"Solanum filirhachis is remarkably similar to a suite of species of the Geminata clade with ruffled leaf margins and long filiform inflorescences (S. leptorhachis Bitter and S. nematorhachis S.Knapp from the W Andean slopes in Colombia and Ecuador and S. tenuiflagellatum S.Knapp of Venezuela). Knapp (2002, 2008) treated these as members of her S. confine species group, all of whose members have a thin inflorescence rhachis, small flowers and leaves with ruffled (undulate) margins, although this latter character is impossible to see in herbarium specimens. Solanum filirhachis differs from those species in its distribution and in the tufts of trichomes in the abaxial leaf vein axils (domatia); other members of this morphologically similar set of species are glabrous or have fine, golden pubescence. The only Brazilian species Knapp (2002) placed in this group was S. stipulatum which can be easily distinguished from S. filirhachis by its shorter inflorescences, flowers with reflexed corolla lobes and winged stems with anisophyllous difoliate, geminate sympodial units. Solanum stipulatum is usually a shrub of watercourses, and often grows amongst rocks and is submerged in floods, while S. filirhachis is a slender treelet of forest understory. The relationships of the S. confine group have not yet been tested using molecular markers.
Another Brazilian species with which S. filirhachis could be confused is S. campaniforme that has similar (but somewhat stouter) elongate inflorescences and tufts of uniseriate trichomes in the abaxial leaf vein axils. Solanum filirhachis has leaves with ruffled margins tht normally dry pale green and smaller flowers (0.6-0.8 cm in diameter) that (at least in the type specimen) are tinged purple; S. campaniforme has leaves with entire, non-ruffled margins that normally dry black or brownish balck and larger flowers (1.2-1.8 cm in diameter) with strongly cucullate corolla lobes.

"
wfo-1000020804,"The affinities of C. benoistii have not yet been explored and, due to the lack of data on some morphological characters, it is not assigned to any of the recognised clades. This species is poorly known and information about corolla colour, fruit and seed characters and chromosome number are still lacking. However, C. benoistii is distinctive in its deeply-lobed stellate corolla (lobes three times longer than the tube) and in the presence of heterostylous flowers. These features, plus the short flowering pedicels (13–20 mm long), distinguish C. benoistii from C. geminifolium, a morphological similar species, which has campanulate corollas that are lobed less than 1/3 of the way to the base and homostylous flowers."
wfo-0001020153,"Capsicum lycianthoides is a member of the Andean clade. It is easily recognised by its glabrous stems and leaves, large ovate to broadly ovate leaves, 2–5 calyx appendages that are sometimes horn-like, showy, broadly campanulate, yellow (often spotted dark brown) corollas and orange or red non-pungent fruits. The name C. lycianthoides has been ignored in literature and the species has been confused with C. geminifolium, a sympatric species. Both species share pendent flowering pedicels, yellow corollas and orange to red non-pungent fruits, but C. geminifolium is a pubescent plant with smaller membranous, elliptic or narrowly elliptic leaves, longer flowering pedicels (up to 27 mm vs. 15 mm in C. lycianthoides) and campanulate (stellate in outline) corollas (vs. broadly campanulate, pentagonal in ouline, in C. lycianthoides)."
wfo-1000021598,"Capsicum regale belongs to the Andean clade. It is the most striking species of the genus with a set of unique traits, such as its unbranched or forked inflorescence with 5–13 deciduous flowers on an elongate rachis, fleshy and laterally compressed calyx appendages, strongly thickened and brilliant purple fruiting pedicels, dark blue to purple fruits and black seeds. This species is morphologically most similar to C. longifolium with which it shares lack of pubescence, multi-flowered inflorescences, yellow corollas, laterally compressed calyx appendages and black seeds. It differs from C. longifolium in its occasionally forked inflorescence (vs. unbranched in C. longifolium), elliptic (vs. narrowly elliptic) leaves, dark purple pedicels in fruit (vs. green) and purple (vs. orange) berries. Capsicum regale can be distinguished from C. dimorphum, which also has pure yellow corollas or with maroon pigmentation, calyx lacking appendages or with short appendages and black seeds, in its glabrescence, its larger major leaves and ovate minor leaves, its unbranched or forked 5–13-flowered inflorescence and its blue or purple fruits. Capsicum dimorphum is usually a pubescent plant, with smaller major leaves and orbicular or ovate (rarely elliptic) minor leaves, unbranched inflorescence of 1–5 flowers and orange to red fruits."
wfo-0001020173,"Capsicum minutiflorum is a member of the Bolivian clade. This poorly-known species has few collections and is one of the five Bolivian species (with C. caballeroi, C. ceratocalyx, C. coccineum and C. neei) with yellow corollas. The calyx normally has five short appendages, but in some specimens (Buchtien 2231 and Vargas C. et al. 2173), they are lacking. Capsicum minutiflorum is often confused with the sympatric C. baccatum var. baccatum and C. neei. All these three taxa share the few-flowered inflorescences and the red pungent fruits. Capsicum minutiflorum and C. neei can be distinguished by its yellow corollas with greenish-yellow spots within (vs. white corollas with greenish-yellow spots within in C. baccatum var. baccatum), this character not being evident in herbarium specimens. In addition, C. minutiflorum and C. neei plants are few-branched taller shrubs with globose fruits. In contrast, C. baccatum plants can be highly-branched perennial herbs, subshrubs or shrubs growing up to 1.5 m (rarely more) and have globose to ellipsoid fruits. Capsicum minutiflorum differs from C. neei in its geniculate and erect flowering pedicels and a weakly nerved calyx with five equal, short appendages, while C. neei has non-geniculate, pendent flowering pedicels and strongly-nerved calyx with 10 unequal appendages. Another sympatric species is the more widespread C. coccineum, which differs from C. minutiflorum by its peculiar sprawling or scrambling habit, its showy multi-flowered inflorescences and its calyx with 0–10 unequal appendages."
wfo-0001025654,"Solanum abortivum may be most closely related to another New Guinea endemic, S. saruwagedensis, but the material available of both is limited. It differs from S. saruwagedensis in its paired leaves, reduced prickles, especially on the leaves, reduced inflorescence, and slightly more abundant stellate hairs. Despite the pedicellate flower apparently from the leaf axil it is readily separated from any species of genus Lycianthes by the presence of stellate hairs, prickles and clearly developed calyx lobes. Etymology: The name refers to the apparently abortive rachis above the solitary flower."
wfo-0001020086,"Capsicum flexuosum is the single member of the Flexuosum clade (Carrizo García et al. 2016). It is a highly variable species in its pubescence density that varies from absent (plants glabrous) to moderate or dense on young branches, leaves and calyx; on leaves, the simple eglandular trichomes are located mainly on the abaxial surface of the lamina. The name C. mositicum was applied to glabrous or glabrescent specimens with a tuft of trichomes in the abaxial leaf vein axils. Another striking aspect of C. flexuosum is the profuse, dichotomous-divaricate branching at the apex of young branches that give the plant a messy aspect, with crowded leaves, flowers and fruits; C. ramosissimum was described, based on this peculiar trait. It is possible that this growth pattern is caused by a plant/pathogen (bacterium, fungus, virus or insect)."
wfo-0001020250,"Capsicum tovarii appears as an isolated branch in the phylogeny of the genus and it is recognised as the distinct Tovarii clade. This species has been rarely collected (< 10 collections) in Central Peru and the majority of the collections have been made by the late Peruvian botanist Oscar Tovar (USM). The species deserves more field observations to better understand the morphological variation in trichome type, corolla colour, heteromorphism of styles, number of carpels, breeding system and area of distribution. The pubescence varies from glabrescent with a predominance of small glandular trichomes along leaf veins, petioles and pedicels to moderately pubescent with predominance of antrorse eglandular trichomes hiding the glandular ones (but these were somewhat visible by virtue of their dark head). The corolla colour has been annotated as purple or purple-blue in Tovar´s labels (e.g. Tovar 1867, 5012 & 5363), but corollas that are entirely cream or cream with two green spots within are also reported in the protologue (Eshbaugh et al. 2013). Similar cream or pale yellow corollas have been observed in plants obtained from seeds from Pariahuanca-Huancayo (sent by O. Tovar in 1999 to A. T. Hunziker, CORD), in which corollas were pale yellow with two green spots at the base of each lobes and throat, while others had purple tones in the interpetalar membrane (Hunziker 25654). In a different plant from the same seed accession (Hunziker 25655), corollas displayed an evident purple pigmentation in the lobes and adjacent zone of the throat, as was seen by Barboza in another population from Potrero, Huancayo (Barboza 5044). The style is dimorphic, flowers either have short (1–1.6 mm long) or long styles (4.2–7 mm long - only a few styles measured) and the ovary is 2–4-carpellar (also needs more observations). "
wfo-0001020030,"Capsicum campylopodium belongs to the Atlantic Forest clade. It is characterised by its small flowers, hemispherical calyx with a circular outline, white corolla with golden yellow or ochraceous spots, locules with only two ovules and depressed fruits with not more than four seeds. In herbarium material, the morphology of the fruits is not always preserved. However, in living material, the number of seeds per locule (2), the size of the seeds (large in proportion to the size of the fruit) and the arrangement of the seeds (parallel, but not touching) results in a slightly depressed fruit, rather than spherical, which is a more common fruit shape in other species. Capsicum flexuosum, C. schottianum and C. campylopodium all lack calyx appendages and are sometimes extremely difficult to distinguish from one another due to some characters being poorly preserved in herbarium specimens. Capsicum campylopodium and C. schottianum both have clearly geniculate pedicels, a calyx with five evident nerves and greenish-golden yellow fruits with brownish-black to black seeds. The distinction of C. campylopodium from C. schottianum is based on calyx shape and size (hemispherical and ? 1.5 mm in diameter vs. cup-shaped and > 2 mm in diameter in C. schottianum), corolla colour (mostly white with large golden yellow spots within vs. white usually with purple and greenish-yellow spots within), fruit shape (globose-depressed vs. globose or subglobose) and number of seeds (four, very rarely six vs. ? six). The separation of C. flexuosum, the most distinctive species of the three, is based primarily on its lack of geniculate pedicels and its having a calyx with ten evident nerves, white corolla with yellowish-green spots within and red fruits."
wfo-1000029585,"Capsicum mirum belongs to the Atlantic Forest clade. It is a beautiful species due to its profuse flowering branches, the intensely purple buds and corollas and the long and spreading calyx appendages. Although C. mirum is a very attractive plant, it has been poorly collected. Capsicum mirum is morphologically similar to C. cornutum, C. mirabile and C. carassense with which it shares geniculate flowering pedicels at anthesis, stellate corollas, pungent fruits, brownish-black to black seeds with seed coat reticulate and tuberculate at margins and similar habitat. Capsicum schottianum is easily differentiated from C. mirum by its glabrescent to moderate pubescence, greenish-white buds, lack of calyx appendages (or five minute appendages) and mostly white corolla with a different intensity of the purple spots within. No intermediate individuals have been found in the area, but intensive field explorations are needed to better understand the range of C. mirum and if it hybridises with C. schottianum."
wfo-0001028396,"In habit and most vegetative and reproductive characters, Solanum hieronymi is similar to S. comptum but can distinguished by its white corolla (vs. light blue in S. comptum), larger (1.5-2.2x1-2 cm) depressed globose fruits with a weakly accrescent fruiting calyx [vs. smaller (0.8-1x0.7-1.3 cm) globose fruits completely covered by the accrescent fruiting calyx], and small stellate hairs with central rays of 1-4 cells that are longer than the lateral rays (vs. central rays consisting of 1-2 cells and shorter or equal to the lateral rays). In S. hieronymi, large stellate hairs with stout yellow prickle-like stalks are absent or sparsely distributed on the petioles and calyces. In S. comptum, the same stellae are sparsely to moderately distributed on the stem, petioles, leaf blades, inflorescence axes, and pedicels, and densely so on the calyces. Solanum hieronymi also has short (up to 0.3 mm long) unbranched glandular hairs that are moderately to densely distributed throughout the plant, whereas S. comptum completely lacks glandular hairs.

wfo-0001028814,"In habit and reproductive characters, Solanum juvenale resembles S. aridum, and intermediate forms can be found where the two species' ranges overlap (Morton 1976; Chiarini 2007). Solanum juvenale can be separated from S. aridum by the moderate to dense distribution of prickles on the stem, petioles, leaf blades, inflorescence axes, pedicels, and especially calyces, whereas S. aridum is without prickles or sparsely armed. The prickles on the leaf blades are usually much longer in S. juvenale (up to 8 mm long), whereas in S. aridum they are up to 3 mm long. Solanum juvenale also has smaller leaf blades (1.8-5.5x1-2.5 cm) that are more deeply lobed compared to the larger leaf blades of S. aridum (2-10x1-5 cm) that are shallowly lobed to sinuate. The ploidy level consistently differs between the two species, with S. juvenale being 2n = 48 and S. aridum being 2n = 24. Experimental crosses in the greenhouse between S. aridum and S. juvenale produced triploid plants (2n = 36; Chiarini 2007).

Another diagnostic character for S. comptum is the presence of large stellate hairs with stout yellow prickle-like stalks up to 6 mm long and terminated with 4-8 lateral rays and a 2-celled central ray. In S. comptum, these prickle-like stellae are sparsely to moderately distributed on the stem, petioles, leaf blades, inflorescence axes, and pedicels, and densely so on the calyces. In S. hieronymi, prickle-like stellae are absent or sometimes sparsely distributed on the petioles and calyces. Finally, S. comptum lacks the short (up to 0.3 mm long) unbranched glandular hairs that are moderately to densely distributed on plants of S. hieronymi.

wfo-0001031651,"Solanum taitense is a medium-sized shrub recognized by its apically rounded subentire leaves, sparse inconspicuous prickles under 1(2) mm long, frequent branching, rarely more than 2 flowers per inflorescence, and relatively small corollas and short anthers. Trichomes on the adaxial sides of the leaf have short, dilated stalks, and the rays are reduced in size and pointing upwards. Solanum taitense is partly sympatric with S. hastifolium and identification can be difficult due to the variable nature of the latter. No single morphological character separates all the specimens, but S. taitense has the majority of the following characters; entire to subentire leaves 1.2-3(3.5) cm long (versus lobed leaves 2.6-6.5 cm long in S. hastifolium), inconspicuous prickles up to 1(2) mm long (versus abundant prickles 1-4 mm long, spaced 3-10 mm apart in S. hastifolium), 1-2(3) flowers per inflorescence (versus 3-5 flowers per inflorescence in S. hastifolium), corolla 1-1.7 cm in diameter (versus corolla 1.4-2 cm in diameter in S. hastifolium), anthers 4-6 mm long (versus anthers 5-8 mm long in S. hastifolium), plant densely pubescent (versus plant sparsely to moderately pubescent in S. hastifolium), and stalked trichomes on all vegetative surfaces with inflated trichome stalks on the adaxial side of the leaves (versus trichomes sessile to shortly stalked in S. hastifolium). Solanum setaceum occurs to the south of S. taitense with limited range overlap; S. setaceum can be identified by the bristles over 2.5 mm long on its young stems. Solanum taitense has frequently been confused with the S. cyaneopurpureum due to shared small subentire leaves, highly branched form and stalked trichomes. The distribution ranges of these species do not overlap as S. cyaneopurpureum is found further east in Uganda and western Tanzania to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Solanum taitense can be distinguished from S. cyaneopurpureum by its rounded leaf apices (versus acute or sometimes obtuse leaf apices in S. cyaneopurpureum) and inflorescences with 1-2(3) flowers (versus inflorescences with 3-10 flowers in S. cyaneopurpureum).
"
wfo-0001031786,"Solanum torreanum is a rare climber recognizable by its deeply lobed leaves that are dark on herbarium specimens and curved prickles. The few known collections have often been misidentified as S. capense due to the shared dark reddish color leaves on dry herbarium specimens and curved prickles, but S. torreanum is further north that any known population of S. capense and has larger leaves and more flowers per inflorescence. Solanum torreanum is also similar to the widespread South African S. rubetorum, and can be distinguished from it by the hooked prickles (versus prickles mostly straight in S. rubetorum), and petioles 1/3-1/2 of the leaf length (versus 1/4-1/3 of the leaf length in S. rubetorum). Solanum torreanum occurs within the distribution range of S. catombelense; it is easy to distinguish from the latter by its dark red-brown leaf color on herbarium specimens (versus dull grey-green, sometimes yellow-green leaf color in S. catombelense), corolla 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter (versus 0.9-1.3 cm in diameter in S. catombelense), and porrect trichomes on the stems and abaxial sides of the leaf with 4(5) rays (versus 6-8 rays in S. catombelense).

wfo-0001026831,"Solanum capense is a slender shrublet recognized by its dense covering of curved prickles and porrect trichomes with 6-7 rays on all vegetative parts. The species concept adopted here encompasses a range of local morphologies. Populations from south of the Drakensberg mountains in the Eastern Cape (South Africa) have deeply lobed leaves with rounded asymmetric lobes, light yellow prickles with wide bases, 2-6 prickles on the leaves, filiform pedicels, white flowers and a dark drying color. The equally abundant populations from the Western Cape province, Namaqualand and Namibia have leaves with more even and apically pointed lobes, orange prickles with narrow bases, no prickles on the leaves, more stout pedicels, mauve flowers, and a yellow-green drying color. A few recent collections from Namibia are similar to the western group but have larger narrow leaves and fewer prickles. The populations from Western Cape (South Africa), Namaqualand and Namibia are probably what Bitter (1923) and Jaeger (1985) understood as S. namaquense; unfortunately, the type material of S. namaquense has not been found and is probably destroyed. There is potential for confusion with the following partially sympatric species: S. humile along western coast of South Africa and Namibia, S. catombelense in Namaqualand, Namibia and Angola, S. burchellii in the Northern Cape and southern half of Namibia, S. supinum in inland areas, and S. tomentosum in the Western and Eastern Cape. Solanum capense from Namaqualand and Namibia can be highly reminiscent of S. humile in its habit and leaf morphology and is distinguished by its curved prickles 3-5 mm long (versus straight prickles 4-13 mm long in S. humile). Solanum capense is easy to distinguish from S. catombelense by its leaves that are almost always 1.5-2.5 cm long (versus 3-8 cm long in S. catombelense) and lobed for 1/3-2/3 of the distance to the midvein (versus less than 1/4 of the distance to the midvein in S. catombelense). Solanum capense can be distinguished from S. burchellii by its curved prickles (versus prickles straight or absent in S. burchellii) and leaves lobed for &frac12;-2/3 of the distance to the midvein (versus leaves almost entire in S. burchellii). Most specimens of S. supinum are easily identifiable by their deeply-dissected leaves, but confusion has occurred with the almost entire-leaved populations of S. supinum (previously S. leucophaeum) from the area around Queenstown in Eastern Cape. Solanum capense can be reliably distinguished from S. supinum by its fruting calyx lobes under 3-5 mm long (versus fruiting calyx lobes to 0.8-1.4 cm long in S. supinum), orange fruit 0.65-1 cm diameter (versus yellow fruit 1.2-1.5 cm in diameter in S. supinum), and many-flowered inflorescences (versus solitary flowers in S. supinum). Solanum capense can also be distinguished from S. tomentosum by its abundant curved prickles (versus prickles straight or absent in S. tomentosum). The abundant light-colored hooked prickles and deeply-lobed leaves of the Eastern Cape S. capense populations are highly reminiscent of S. sodomaeodes. Solanum sodomaeodes is found to the east of the distribution range of S. capense and can be distinguished by its stalked 4-rayed or uniradiate trichomes with elongated midpoints or completely glabrous epidermis (versus almost sessile trichomes with 6-7 rays and reduced midpoints, always present in S. capense)."
wfo-0001031761,"Most material (ca. 80%) of S. tomentosum we have examined can be readily identified in dry herbarium specimens by the thick reddish indumentum on all surfaces except the corolla. Solanum tomentosum as circumscribed here is a robust-looking shrub with acute leaf apices, trichome stalks up to 0.5 mm long, bright orange fruit 1-2 cm in diameter, inconspicuous flowers that are rarely pressed open on herbarium specimens, and moderate numbers of straight prickles. It has a long history of cultivation in European botanic gardens. Delimitation of this species is problematic due to the variable populations in the Eastern Cape combining one or more of the following characteristics; sparse sessile trichomes, rounded leaf apices, more slender habit, and fruit as small as 0.75 cm in diameter. Plants with all the above characteristics have been identified as S. coccineum, or S. tomentosum var. coccineum. The indumentum, leaf shape, and fruit size vary independently of one another and it has not been possible to establish a boundary between these taxa. We follow Bitter (1923) and Jaeger (1985) in placing the name S. coccineum as a synonym of S. tomentosum. Specimens of S. tomentosum have been confused with the stalked-trichome populations of S. rubetorum in the eastern Cape, where the two taxa are sympatric. Solanum tomentosum can be distinguished from S. rubetorum by its stout pedicels (versus filiform pedicels in S. rubetorum), shallowly lobed leaves (versus deeply lobed leaves in S. rubetorum), trichomes with 7-8 rays and short midpoints on the adaxial leaf surfaces (versus reduced number of rays and elongated midpoints on the adaxial leaf surfaces in S. rubetorum). Many specimens of S. rubetorum have straight prickles pointed slightly downwards, whereas all prickles of S. tomentosum are perpendicular to the stem. Solanum tomentosum is similar to the more uniform and partly sympatric S. burchellii. It can be distinguished by its ovate leaves (versus elliptic or rarely ovate leaves in S. burchellii), rounded to cordate leaf bases (versus cuneate or sometimes rounded leaf bases in S. burchellii), and red-green, pale grey-green or pale yellow-green leaves on herbarium specimens (versus uniform yellow-green color in S. burchellii)."
wfo-0001030918,"Solanum rubetorum is recognizable by its deeply lobed leaves with some secondary lobe development that are dark reddish brown on herbarium specimens, fairly lax inflorescences with long peduncles, and trichomes on the adaxial sides of leaves with markedly fewer, shorter rays than those of the abaxial surfaces. Its leaf and prickle morphology can be quite variable. We place S. didymanthum in the synonymy of S. rubetorum with some reservations as its stalked trichomes differentiate it from other specimens S. rubetorum in Kwa-Zulu Natal. Historically there has been confusion between S. rubetorum and S. humile, as the name S. rigescens was widely applied to all smaller-leaved South African taxa with straight prickles. The distribution range of S. rubetorum in the southern and eastern Cape does not in fact overlap with that of S. humile in Namaqualand and further north; S. rubetorum can be distinguished from S. humile by its discolorous deeply-dissected leaves usually with at least some secondary lobe development and primary lobes 0.5-2 cm long (versus concolorous leaves with shallow simple lobes 0.2-0.5 cm long in S. humile). Solanum rubetorum is partly sympatric with S. capense, S. catombelense, S. sodomaeodes, S. supinum, and S. tomentosum. Solanum rubetorum is easy to distinguish from S. capense and S. sodomaeodes by its predominantly straight prickles (versus hooked prickles in S. capense and S. sodomaeodes). Solanum rubetorum differs from S. catombelense and S. tomentosum by its leaves with at least some secondary lobing and few-rayed trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface (versus leaves with primary lobes only and trichomes with 6-8 rays on the adaxial leaf surface in S. catombelense and S. tomentosum). Solanum supinum can display ambiguous leaf morphology and its identity can be established by its single flowers, pentagonal corolla, and an accrescent spiny calyx. Vegetatively, S. rubetorum can be reminiscent of the more northern S. richardii, but differs by its smaller flowers, more deeply dissected corolla, straight prickles, and the lack of hooked prickles on the calyx."
wfo-0001029332,"Solanum malindiense is a rare Kenyan endemic with yellowish leaves, long-acuminate calyx lobes, and curved prickles. Solanum malindiense is similar to the more southern S. usaramense from the coastal areas of Mozambique, Tanzania, and southern Kenya, but S. malindiense can be distinguished by its corolla 2.8-3.7 cm in diameter (versus corolla 2.5-3 cm diameter in S. usaramense) and yellow berries ca. 1.5 cm in diameter (versus red berries 0.8-1.1 cm in diameter in S. usaramense). The semi-scandent habit and yellowish regularly undulate leaves of S. malindiense are reminiscent of two other coastal species: the partly sympatric S. zanzibarense and S. litoraneum from coastal Mozambique and Tanzania, although the corollas, anthers and fruit are larger than in either of these species.
"
wfo-0001027359,"Solanum cyaneopurpureum is a small shrubby species with a somewhat tangled appearance, usually entire leaves under 5 cm long, and a yellowish leaf drying color. It is the only species of the Anguivi grade primarily distributed in the Lake Victoria Basin regional mosaic and the Guineo-Congolan phytogeographical areas (White 1983; Jaeger & Hepper 1986). Solanum cyaneopurpureum occurs to the west of the morphologically similar S. zanzibarense. Only isolated collections of S. cyaneopurpureum have been recorded in in central Tanzania (Somalia-Masai phytochorion) between the main distributions of S. cyaneopurpureum and S. zanzibarense. There are no differences between the reproductive structures of S. cyaneopurpureum and S. zanzibarense and no single character separates all the specimens, but Solanum cyaneopurpureum can be distinguished by the combination of the following characters; leaves shorter than 5 cm and almost always entire (versus leaves that are usually longer than 5 cm and lobed in S. zanzibarense), prickles usually absent or under 2 mm long (versus prickles usually present and over 2 mm long in S. zanzibarense), branches short and erect (versus branches longer, slender, and prostrate in S. zanzibarense), and trichomes on the leaves and stems with stalks ca. 0.1 mm long (versus leaf and stem trichomes that are sessile or with stalks under 0.1 mm long in S. zanzibarense). Solanum cyaneopurpureum has frequently been confused with the Kenyan (or rarely northern Tanzanian) S. taitense due to their shared small subentire leaves, straggly habit and stalked trichomes. The distribution ranges of these species do not in fact overlap; S. cyaneopurpureum can be distinguished from S. taitense by its acute or sometimes obtuse leaf apices (versus rounded leaf apices in S. taitense) and inflorescences with 3-10 flowers (versus inflorescences with 1-2(3) flowers in S. taitense).
"
wfo-0001025694,"The plurifoliate sympodial units, ferruginous to reddish tomentum with stellate-glandular hairs, and large berries with large seeds and a pubescent exocarp identify Solanum achorum as a member of Solanum sect. Erythrotrichum. Additionally, parsimony analyses of sequence data from three molecular markers (nuclear ITS and waxy or GBSSI and chloroplast trnT-F) place Solanum achorum in this section; however, the relationships within the group are incompletely resolved due to a lack of taxon sampling and require further study (S. Stern and L. Bohs, unpub. data). The inflorescence structure of Solanum achorum, being branched with both hermaphroditic and staminate flowers, would place it in Agra's (2008) subsect. Rhytidoandrum Agra; however, this relationship has not been tested phylogenetically using molecular data. Of the 23 species of sect. Erythrotrichum that Agra (2008) recognized, only three occur in Peru, with one species, Solanum urubambaense Agra, endemic to southern Peru in the area around Cuzco. Solanum achorum can be distinguished from the two members of sect. Erythrotrichum occurring in northern Peru and southern Ecuador by a number of characters. It shares a similar vegetative appearance with Solanum megaspermum Agra, especially regarding habit, pubescence, and leaf shape; however, Solanum megaspermum has more robust inflorescences (> 30 flowers vs. 4-12 flowers in Solanum achorum) and larger seeds (5-5.5x2-3 mm vs. 3-5x1.5-3.5 mm in Solanum achorum). Solanum achorum also shares many characteristics with Solanum velutinum Dunal, including a scandent habit, similar pubescence, and similar-sized white corollas, but Solanum achorum has a branched inflorescence that can reach 20 cm versus inflorescences to 6 cm long in Solanum velutinum. The calyx lobes in Solanum achorum are 2-4 mm in length and not foliaceous while those of Solanum velutinum are commonly over 10 mm long and foliaceous.

wfo-0001026912,"Brown (1931) recognized the entity we here delimit as S. caumii as two varieties of S. nelsonii, a coastal species found on many islands in the Hawaiian archipelago. St. John (1988) placed S. nelsonii var. acuminatum in synonymy with S. nelsonii var. caumii. Solanum caumii is most similar to S. nelsonii but it can be distinguished by its semi-erect habit, larger leaf length to width ratio, and sometimes red fruit. In 2008, plants of S. nelsonii s.s. from Molokai were cultivated alongside individuals from Nihoa (S. caumii) in greenhouses at the New York Botanical Garden (made available through the conservation program at the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Honolulu by Drs. David and Lida Burney and their staff). Under identical growing conditions plants here recognized as S. caumii and S. nelsonii s.s. maintained their distinct forms."
wfo-0001031587,"Solanum superbum is closely related to S. abitaguense and S. cucullatum. It differs from those species in its dense indument of dendritic trichomes but like them is unusual in section Geminata in possessing large fleshy flowers. Although the fruits are not known for S. superbum, I expect them to be large (to 4 cm diam.) like those of its close relatives. The possession of branched trichomes on all parts of S. superbum would have excluded it from section Geminata in previous classifications of the group (see Seithe, 1962; D’Arcy, 1974). The polarity of this character is in doubt for all of Solanum, as many groups and species previously thought to have only simple or branched trichomes now are found to possess both types (see Knapp, 2002)."
wfo-0001030278,"Many attributes make S. pectinatum a promising species for agriculture. The fruits are large and glabrous at maturity and have a delightful sweet-tart flavor. The species could be widely cultivated at low and middle elevations in the tropics where S. quitoense is unsuccessful. Fruits of S. pectinatum are reported to be eaten and occasionally cultivated by indians in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The species should be studied for its agricultural potential by tropical plant breeders. The vestiture, composed of simple, uniseriate hairs, sets S. pectinatum apart from other species of section Lasiocarpa and is reminiscent of section Acanthophora Dunal. In spite of this anomaly, S. pectinatum has many traits that unite it with section Lasiocarpa, including growth habit, leaf morphology, inflorescence structure, floral morphology, and the nature of the fruit, all of which are quite ordinary for the section. Relationships of S. pectinatum within section Lasiocarpa are uncertain. A phylogenetic affinity with S. lasiocarpum and S. quitoense is tentatively suggested because of similarity in fruit vestiture and flavonoid chemistry (Whalen, unpublished). Glycosides of the flavonol kampferol are largely restricted to these species within the section. The names S. pectinatum and S. hirsutissimum are both in wide use for this species. Although S. pectinatum is the earlier name, its publication is predated by S. pectinatum Gilles ex Nees (1843), a name listed in Index Kewensis. The latter name is not validly published, however, because it was merely mentioned in passing by Nees and was not accompanied by a diagnosis. It is clear that Nees had no intention of publishing a new species. (See articles 34.1 and 34.3 of the code.) Since the Nees name is invalid, it is not an obstacle to the use of S. pectinatum Dunal. The presence of this species in a remote area of southern Veracruz in Mexico was recently brought to our attention by Dr. Michael Nee of the Field Museum. The known Veracruz collections are cited above and represent a considerable range extension for S. pectinatum, previously unknown north of Costa Rica. Because the part of Veracruz where these plants were found has been only recently explored, Nee believes that populations are native and are not recent introductions (M. Nee, personal communication). Commentary of Bohs (2005): Although typical specimens of S. pectinatum are distinguished by their unbranched hairs, some collections are reported to have sessile- to short-stalked stellate stem hairs with spreading or ascending rays and midpoints as long or longer than the lateral rays (Bohs, 2004; Bruneau et al., 1995). At least one of these collections is from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, a locality far to the southeast of other S. pectinatum collections (Whalen et al., 1981). Molecular sequences of accessions with simple vs. stellate hairs are very similar (Bohs, 2004). Thus, the taxonomic concept of S. pectinatum probably should be expanded to include variants with stellate trichomes."
wfo-0001028234,"In Sonora and N Sinaloa, S. greyi is sympatric with another member of series Pacificum, S. lumholtzianum. In this region, hybridisation and displacement of reproductive characters has resulted in the formation of a small-flowered and otherwise distinctive race of S. greyi (see Whalen, 1978), from which, unfortunately, Rose took his type mateiral for the species. In order to distinguish thes two races as taxonomic varieties, it was necessary to call the locally derived and smaller flowered race var. greyi and to apply a new name to the more widely distributed and larger flowered form (var. grandiflorum)."
wfo-0001028235,This is the commonly encountered form of Solanum greyi. 
wfo-0001028236,"Altough the small flowers of this taxon appear to be the result of selection for reproductive isolation from the sympatric and related Solanum lumholtzianum (Whalen, 1978), the whitish, ovoid fruiting calyx is characteristic of that species and was perhaps acquired through hybridisation between S. greyi var. greyi and S. lumholtzianum.
"
wfo-0001025714,"The question remains as to where S. aculeatissimum is native. Two hypotheses can be made to explain the present distribution: (1) It is native to South America and has been a post-Columbian introduction to Africa. Then all 19 species of sect. Acanthophora would be native to the New World,a nd its spread would parellel that of S. capsicoides, S. viarum and S. mammosum. Alternatively, (2) it is native to Africa, where its remote ancestors had become established by long-distance dispersal from the undoubted center of sect. Acanthophora in South America. Within the last few centuries it has become established in South America by human transport. Speaking for the second hypothesis is its abundance in Africa contrasting with its rather limited distribution in South America where it should potentially have the capability of spreading widely. This is not necessarily conclusive, however, as the range of S. capsicoides (Nee, 1979) and S. mauritianum Scop. (Roe, 1972) demonstrate. The species was first collected in Brazil by Saint Hilaire in 1816-1821, while in Africa it is known from at least 1772-1774 or 1786-1795 when Masson collected the type of S. aculeatissimum var. hispidissimum from the Cape of Good Hope. I highly suspect that the uniform populations in European botanical gardnes were originally introduced form South Africa where very similar appearing plants are found. The type of S. aculeatissimum was growing in Vienna by 1787 and none of the sheets I have seen form South America exactly match it, although many African collections do. The great variation in leaf lobing and pubescence found in Africa would also argue for its being native there. The rare occurence in Africa of large seeds is puzzling. Both collections (Louis 5020 and Pierlot 2705) are from Zaire and the specimens are undoubtedly S. aculeatissimum. There is a slight possibility of hybridization with S. dasyphyllum Schum. & Thonn. which has similar fruits and seeds. But this common African species also has abundant stalked stellate hairs, winged petioles and rotate corollas, among other characters, none of which are apparent on the two collections cited above.
At present there is no way of definitely establishing S. aculeatissimum as native of either Africa or South America, without further study of the ecology, morphological variation and genetic relationships among the various populations."
wfo-0001030067,"Solanum oligacanthum is immediately recognisable by its adult leaves. They are entire, orbicular or broadly ovate, and less than 25 mm long. Solanum orbiculatum from the Northern Territory and Western Australia also has orbicular or broadly ovate leaves, but they are larger with longer petioles and the fruits are larger. Symon (1981) found (2) 5 (7) seeds in 12 fruits counted."
wfo-0001032351,"Solanum versicolor is related to S. esuriale, but differs by the corky bark, the presence of finger hairs on both the upper leaf surface and the calyx, the absence of a common peduncle, the pedicels 11-26 mm long at anthesis (5-9 mm long for S. esuriale), the white corolla, and the moderate to dense stellae on the calyx (very dense for S. esuriale). Etymology: From the Latin versicolor meaning different or varying colour, a reference to the green, sparsely hairy pedicels, which contrast strongly with the white, densely hairy rachises and branchlets."
wfo-0001025892,"Solanum ammophilum is close to S. coactiliferum, but differs by the leaves 6-10 times longer than wide (4-6 times for S. coactiliferum); branchlet stellae with 8-13 lateral rays; leaf stellae with 8-10 lateral rays (vs. 7-8 lateral rays for S. coactiliferum); stellae stalks <0.1 mm long (vs. 0.1-0.2 mm long for S. coactiliferum); the corolla glabrous on the inner surface (stellate-hairy for S. coactiliferum), and the presence of very short, gland-tipped hairs on the lower leaf surface. The glandular papillae on the ovary and lower half of style are unique among Queensland species. These papillae persist on the fruits, and give them a distinctly sticky texture. Conservation status: Moderately widespread. Not considered at risk. Etymology: from the Greek ammo- (of the sand) and -philus (loving). This species occurs on soils that are much sandier than the prevalent soil type in the area."
wfo-0001026924,"Solanum centrale has not been recorded for Queensland until Bean’s 2004 publication. The specimens cited from Queensland are a good match for specimens from the Northern Territory, including the type. However, the N.T. material tends to have leaves more rusty in colour, shorter prickles, and stellae with a somewhat shorter central ray. Further Queensland material, particularly of the fruits, is needed to confirm the identity. Solanum centrale is closely related to S. jucundum, but differs by its lower stature; the much larger stellae of the branchlets, upper and lower leaf surfaces; absence of very short, gland-tipped hairs from the upper leaf surface; and the glabrous ovary. "
wfo-0001031721,"Solanum jucundum is closely related to S. tetrathecum, but S. jucundum differs by the moderate to very dense indumentum of the upper leaf surface, perennial habit and greater height (up to 1.8 m high), the acute leaf apex, the rostrate to attenuate calyx lobes, the calyx stellae with stalks 0.1-0.4 mm long (0-0.1 mm for S. tetrathecum) and the style bearing very short, gland-tipped hairs only (very short, gland-tipped hairs and stellate hairs for S. tetrathecum). The distributions of S. jucundum and S. tetrathecum overlap considerably, especially around Glenmorgan, Hannaford and Westmar, but they never grow together and there is no intergradation between them."
wfo-0001029087,"Solanum limitare is closely related to S. amblymerum, differing by the longer pedicels both at anthesis and in fruit, the strongly attenuate calyx lobes (deltate for S. amblymerum), the larger stellae of the upper leaf surface, the shorter anthers, the ovary bearing both stipitate glands and stellate hairs, and stellae on the style with 13-20 lateral rays. This species apparently does not exceed 80 cm in height, and may sprout annually from rhizomes. Etymology: The specific epithet is from the Latin limes, limitis meaning “a border or boundary.” This refers to the occurrence of this species on both sides of (and at times right on) the Queensland-New South Wales border."
wfo-0001029160,"The combination of Solanum lumholtzianum with S. greyi by various floristic works is not tenable. Solanum lumholtzianum differs in its flavonoid chemistry and allozyme genotype; adding to the many morphological distinctions - finer cauline prickles, more dissected leaves, anthers of three (rather than two) sizes, ovoid, whitish tinged fruiting calyx and larger seeds with distinctive sunken hila.

wfo-0001028773,"Solanum johnsonianum is distinguished from S. nemophilum by the branchlet stellae with a central ray 3-5 times longer than the lateral rays (0.7-1.2 times for S. nemophilum), central ray similarly much longer on other plant parts, stellae 0.25-0.35 mm diameter on upper leaf surface (0.4-0.7 mm for S. nemophilum), upper leaf surface lacking very short, gland-tipped hairs and stellae without stalks (very short, gland-tipped hairs present, stellae stalks 0.1-0.3 mm long for S. nemophilum). Solanum johnsonianum is also closely related to S. innoxium. It differs from the latter by the broader leaves (1.4-2 times longer than wide), the longer petioles (9-28 mm long), the greater petiole/lamina ratio (30-55%), the larger stellae on the lower leaf surface (0.3-0.6 mm diameter) and the calyx stellae with the central ray often gland-tipped. "
wfo-0001032368,"Solanum vicinum is closely related to Solanum prinophyllum Dunal, and regarded by Symon (1981) as the northern form of that species. Solanum vicinum differs from S. prinophyllum by: branchlets with 90-180 prickles per decimetre (30-65 for S. prinophyllum), branchlet stellae 0.4-0.5 mm in diameter (0.25-0.3 mm in diameter for S. prinophyllum), shallowly-lobed leaves (lobing index of 1.4-1.9 vs. index of 2-4 for S. prinophyllum), inflorescences 3-8 flowered with common peduncle usually present and up to 8 mm long (inflorescences 1-3 flowered, common peduncle absent for S. prinophyllum), and corolla 11-18 mm long (7-9 mm long for S. prinophyllum). Solanum prinophyllum sens. str. is perhaps more closely related to S. pungetium R.Br. than it is to S. vicinum. Solanum prinophyllum and S. pungetium are not easily separable, but Bean (2004) notes the following differences, based on collections from central and southern coast of N.S.W.: The leaves and branchlets of S. prinophyllum are glabrous to sparsely hairy (always moderately to densely hairy for S. pungetium); the stellae of the upper leaf surface in S. prinophyllum (when present) are 0.2-0.35 mm in diameter, with 6-8 lateral rays and the central ray 0-0.7 times as long as the lateral rays. In S. pungetium, the corresponding stellae are 0.35-0.5 mm in diameter, with 4-5 lateral rays and midpoints 1-1.5 times as long as the lateral rays; the leaves, pedicels and calyces of S. prinophyllum tend to have a greater number of prickles; S. prinophyllum leaves have 4-6 pairs of lobes, and the lobes may themselves have small lobes or angles, whereas S. pungetium leaves have 3-4 pairs of lobes, and the lobes are always “simple”. The few specimens seen by Bean (2004) from Victoria suggest that the patterns of variation are different again, and if both species are present there, they are even less distinct. While Bean (2004) feels sure that S. prinophyllum and S. pungetium differ sufficiently to warrant species status for both, it will require a detailed field study to determine the exact relationships involved. The character most often used to separate S. pungetium in identification keys, namely the reduced 1-2 flowered inflorescence without a common peduncle, is not diagnostic. Both species can have this feature. Etymology: From the Latin vicinus - near, neighbouring. This is a reference to its close affinity to S. prinophyllum."
wfo-0001027290,"Solanum crebrispinum is related to S. ellipticum, but differs by the erect habit, the branchlet stellae 0.9-1.2 mm across (0.5-0.8 mm for S. ellipticum) on stalks up to 1.0 mm long (up to 0.3 mm long for S. ellipticum), the presence of protostellae on the upper leaf surface, normal stellae 0.8-1.2 mm across (0.4-0.7 mm for S. ellipticum), on very thick stalks 0.1-0.9 mm long (thin stalks 0-0.3 mm long for S. ellipticum), and the 50-70 calyx prickles (5-50 for S. ellipticum). On the branchlets, upper and lower leaf surface, and on the calyx, the central ray of the stellae is 1-1.7 times as long as the laterals; this compares with 0.5-1 times for S. ellipticum. Conservation status: Collection density in this area is low. Not considered at risk. Etymology: From the Latin crebra - abundant, and spina - spines or prickles. This refers to the abundant prickles on the branchlets and calyx."
wfo-0001031178,"Solanum senticosum is close to S. ellipticum, but differs by the erect shrubby habit; the rusty indumentum on the stems, leaves and calyces; the more densely prickly branchlets; the consistently cuneate leaf bases; the larger stellae on the upper leaf surface; and the calyx with many stout prickles in longitudinal rows. The Symon collection from Riversleigh (Symon 15794)is unusual as it lacks the rusty coloration of the stems and leaves. Etymology: from the Latin senticosus - full of thorns or prickles."
wfo-0001029771,"Solanum nemophilum is distinguished from other species of the S. densevestitum group by the relatively long-stalked stellae on both leaf surfaces, and the stellae with a central ray more or less equal in length to the lateral rays. A Scortechini specimen of S. nemophilum at BRI, reputedly from Roma, is misidentififed and should be disregarded, as there have been no collections of this species from the Maranoa district over the last century. "
wfo-0001032183,"Solanum nemophilum F. Muell. var. brachycarpum was considered by Symon (1981) to be a synonym of S. nemophilum.

wfo-0001028666,"Solanum innoxium is allied to S. nemophilum but differs by the lanceolate leaves, the stellae of the upper leaf surface 0.2-0.3 mm in diameter (0.4-0.7 mm for S. nemophilum), the branchlet stellae with the central ray 3-4 times longer than the lateral rays (0.7-1.2 times for S. nemophilum), the stellae on the lower leaf surface sessile or with stalks to 0.1 mm long (stalks 0.2-0.4 mm for S. nemophilum), style 4-5 mm long (5.5-8 mm long for S. nemophilum) and the ellipsoidal fruits (globular for S. nemophilum). Solanum innoxium differs from S. hapalum by the shorter and narrower leaves, shorter petioles, smaller stellae on the lower leaf surface, shorter style, the relatively long glandular hairs on the ovary, and the ellipsoidal fruits. "
wfo-0001027606,"Solanum dissectum is a very distinct species with no very close relatives. It is probably closest to S. lythrocarpum. Solanum lythrocarpum differs by the entire adult leaves (deeply lobed for S. dissectum); the presence of very short, gland-tipped hairs on the branchlets, leaf lamina and calyx (absent for S. dissectum); the presence of stellate hairs on leaves and calyx (absent for S. dissectum) and the fruiting pedicels 10-19 mm long (18-24 mm long for S. dissectum). It is also close to S. ferocissimum, but it differs from that species by the total lack of stellate hairs and the deeply lobed adult leaves. "
wfo-0001029234,"Solanum lythrocarpum is related to S. dissectum, but differs by the entire adult leaves (deeply lobed for S. dissectum); the presence of very short, gland-tipped hairs on the branchlets, leaf lamina and calyx (absent for S. dissectum); the presence of stellate hairs on leaves and calyx (absent for S. dissectum) and the fruiting pedicels 10-19 mm long (18-24 mm long for S. dissectum). Etymology: From the Greek ‘lythron’ meaning blood, and ‘carpos’ (fruit), in reference to the bright-red colour of the mature fruits."
wfo-0001027289,"Solanum crassitomentosum is related to S. quadriloculatum, but differs by the 1-2 flowered inflorescence (9-15 flowered for S. quadriloculatum), calyx and leaf laminae without prickles (leaves and calyx prickly for S. quadriloculatum), inner surface of corolla densely stellate hairy (vs. glabrous for S. quadriloculatum), central ray of stellae on lower leaf surface 1.5-2 times as long as lateral rays (vs. 0.8-1.2 times for S. quadriloculatum) and the brown to black seeds (vs. pale yellow for S. quadriloculatum). Conservation status: S. crassitomentosum is currently known from 4 locations, all within the White Mountains National Park. There are no substantial threats to the species, and it is not considered to be at risk."
wfo-0001031512,"According to Symon (1981), S. sturtianum is a widespread species that occurs mainly in arid regions in all Australian states except Victoria and Tasmania. It may be one of the largest of the species found in the drier areas of Australia and exceptional specimens nearly 3 m high by 2 m have been seen both in Western Australia and Northern Territory. It is much more variable in western and northwestern Australia than in more easterly areas. The western specimens vary greatly in leaf width where the extreme narrow forms have been called S. morrisonii. In this area there are also forms with denser pubescence and more numerous prickles. Occasional white-flowered forms have been found throughout the range of distribution. When in an advanced stage, the corolla may exude nectar from glands on the back of the petal and the buds are actively worked by ants and honeybees, both of which ignore the open flowers. This phenomenon also occurs in S. tudununggae from Kalumburu on the northwest coast. Solanum sturtianum does not appear to have close relatives amongst the Australian species of Solanum. The few that have some characters in common include S. oligacanthum and S. karsensis with similar rotate corollas, dryish fruits (much smaller in these cases), dark seeds, close, dense, silvery tomentum and relatively simple, sparsely branched stems. Further removed both geographically and morphologically is S. tudununggae, which differs in many ways yet has some definite affinities with S. sturtianum. There are some records of S. sturtianum being toxic to stock, and losses have occurred chiefly in the Broken Hill area of New South Wales and in the Thargomindah district of Queensland."
wfo-0001027510,"Solanum densevestitum differs from all other related species by the stellae on upper leaf surface being sessile, with only 4-5 (rarely 6) lateral rays; the long-stalked stellae of the branchlets (stalks up to 2.0 mm long); and the leaf lower surface green. The collections cited by Bentham in the protologue belong to three species; S. densevestitum (as to lectotype S. stupefactum Symon, and S. hapalum (described in Bean, 2004). The description given in the protologue was clearly derived from a combination of these taxa. The isolectotype cited by Symon (1981) is a mixed specimen. There are three specimens on the sheet; the lowermost piece is S. densevestitum, as to lectotype; the upper two pieces are S. stupefactum Symon. The locality of “Tweed River district” given for a collection by E. Betche in April 1896 (held at NSW) must be regarded with considerable suspicion, as there have been no subsequent collections from there or anywhere nearby. Typical specimens of S. densevestitum and S. nemophilum are readily distinguished by the stellae of the upper leaf surface (stalk length and lateral ray number). However, collections from the Benarkin - Yarraman area appear to be morphologically intermediate and difficult to assign to either species. Juvenile leaves of S. densevestitum are frequently lobed, in a similar fashion to adult leaves of S. gympiense."
wfo-0001027009,"In this species, the basal flower of each inflorescence is larger and pricklier than all other flowers, and only the basal flower develops into a fruit. According to Symon (1981), S. chippendalei is most closely related to S. beaugleholei, S. phlomoides and S. melanospermum. These four species occupy a geographical are from the southern Kimberleys to the Hamersley Range and across central Australia to the south-west corner of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Of these four, S. beaugleholei and S. phlomoides have the appearance of the relics and S. chippendalei and and S. melanospermum give evidence of being more recently evolved. Solanum chippendalei differs from S. phlomoides and S. beaugleholei in its smaller habit, generally shallowly lobed leaves, and slightly smaller fruits and seeds. From S. melanospermum it differs in having greyish rather than rusty tomentum, globular not ovoid fruit, fewer shallow leaf lobes, shorter and stouter pedicels and a calyx not markedly coriaceous and reflexed at maturity. Variation in leaf lobing does occur and when unlobed the species may be difficult to distinguish from S. phlomoides; when deeply lobed it approaches S. melanospermum. The species has been referred to in literature as S. phlomoides, S. melanospermum and S. eremophilum and in the absence of voucher specimens it is not easy to be sure which species were in fact being referred to. The species is named after Mr G. M. Chippendale for his considerable contributions to the botany of the Northern Territory."
wfo-0001026987,"This species and S. ferocissimum are the only red-fruited Solanum species that occur in arid parts of Australia. Both species may have a hastate leaf base, but S. chenopodinum differs by the much broader leaves without prickles on the upper surface, the broad-based prickles on the branchlets, and the shorter fruiting pedicels. Symon (1981) counted seeds from 32 fruits and reported a range from 4 to 16 with a mean of 9, one of the lowest seed numbers per fruit of Australian Solanum species."
wfo-0001028982,"Solanum latens is closely related to S. ferocissimum, but differs by the smaller and broader leaves; juvenile leaves often with 2 pairs of lobes; upper and lower leaf stellae with central ray 1.5-3 times as long as laterals (0-1 times for S. ferocissimum); the 1-3 flowered inflorescences (2-10 flowered for S. ferocissimum); and the seeds 1.6-2.3 mm long (3-3.6 mm for S. ferocissimum). Etymology: From the Latin latens meaning 'secret' or 'hidden'. This is a reference to the late recognition of the species, with most collections being in the last decade."
wfo-0001027930,"Solanum ferocissimum is closely related to S. parvifolium, from which it differs in its more copious prickles, the often sparse, sessile indumentums (making the leaves scarcely discolorous), linear leaves that frequently have a pair of basal lobes, with prickles along the midrib on both surfaces, and by the seeds 3.0-3.6 mm long (1.9-2.3 mm long for S. parvifolium). It is less closely related to S. chenopodinum, from which it differs in leaf shape, prickles, and infructescence. Solanum ferocissimum, S. parvifolium, and S. stelligerum form a closely related trio of species and their separation is not always easy. The major disjunctions in distribution (S. ferocissimum occurs in eastern, western, and central Australia, whereas S. parvifolium and S. stelligerum occur only in eastern Australia) suggest that S. ferocissimum may be a relict species, the original distribution of which has been disrupted by aridity in inland Australia. Like plants of S. chenopodinum, collections of S. ferocissimum in central Australia frequently come from within the shelter of shrubs or the shade of trees. Ross (1986) suggested that S. ferocissimum is doubtfully distinct from S. parvifolium. While it is true that some collections are taxonomically difficult, the great majority of collections may be easily determined. According to Symon (1981), variation in leaf width occurs and young plants frequently have subhastate leaves with basal lobes that are not always evident on mature specimens. Flowers may be white or pale blue. Symon (1981) counted the number of seeds per fruit and found that 14 plants had (8-) 24 (-50) seeds, whereas 6 others counted had 2, 5, and 7 and 9, 10, and 13 seeds."
wfo-0001026870,"Solanum carduiforme is the only dioecious species indigenous to Queensland. The female plants have reduced inflorescences bearing only a single flower. Solanum carduiforme is close to S. chippendalei but differs by the dioecious habit, the more dissected leaves with a much “closer” tomentum, smaller fruits, and accrescent calyx."
wfo-0001028298,"Solanum hapalum is related to S. densevestitum with which Symon (1981) synonymized material here recognised as this species but differs from it by the smaller stellate hairs on all plant parts, the stellate hairs sessile on the lower leaf surface (stalks up to 0.5 mm long for S. densevestitum), the branchlet stellate hairs sessile or almost so, and with 7-8 lateral rays (stalks conspicuous, to 2 mm long, and with 4-6 lateral rays for S. densevestitum) and the ovary with very short, gland-tipped hairs only (very short, gland-tipped hairs and stellate hairs for S. densevestitum). Etymology: from the Latin hapalus, meaning ‘soft to the touch’, in reference to the soft, felty leaves and stems."

Symon (1981) counted (17-)30(-37) seeds in 9 fruits. Bean (2004) suggested that Symon’s (1981) selection of a lectotype was incorrect as Robert Brown only had made a single collection of this plant; however, three sheets exist of this collection, so lectotypification was indeed appropriate. Two subspecies are recognised in Solanum parvifolium, and are distinguished by the following key: Leaves (1.5-) 2.5-7 x 0.5-1.5 cm; very short, gland-tipped hairs absent; ovary with very short, gland-tipped hairs only; style 3.5-6.5 mm long; flowers all bisexual S. parvifolium subsp. parvifolium Leaves 7.5-13.5 x 1.3-3.5 cm; very short, gland-tipped hairs present; ovary either without indumentum or with both stellate hairs and very short, gland-tipped hairs; style 7-9 mm long; male flowers consistently present in the inflorescence S. parvifolium subsp. tropicum Typical S. parvifolium subsp. tropicum differs from S. parvifolium subsp. parvifolium by the longer and broader leaves, the upper leaf surface with very short, gland-tipped hairs, the longer pedicels, the ovary either glabrous or with both stellate hairs and very short, gland-tipped hairs, the longer style and the presence of male flowers in the inflorescence.

Solanum nobile differs by the deeply lobed adult leaves, the sparse indumentum on the upper leaf surface, loose indumentum of lower leaf surface and the larger calyx stellae with longer rays. Solanum nobile occurs to the north of S. curvicuspe, and there is no evidence of intergradation between the species. Etymology: The epithet is from the Latin nobilis, meaning noble or grand.

wfo-0001029308,"Mueller (1867) named Solanum magnifolium, based on a Dallachy specimen or specimens. The exact identity of the type specimen(s) has until now been unclear. A specimen collected by Dallachy from “Murray River” in August 1867 (MEL 11658), precisely matches the details given in the protologue. In particular, this specimen has unusually small prickles on the branchlets (2-3 mm long), the leaves of the specimen are very large (up to 20 x 11 cm), and there are no fruits. These characteristics are confirmed in the protologue (aculei 1-1.5’” longi; foliis ad 9” longa, ad 5” lata; and “baccae ignotae”). The repand-dentate leaves, calyx length and anther length offer further confirmation that Mueller’s description was taken from this specimen, and this specimen alone. Significantly, Bentham (1868) cited Dallachy’s “Murray River” specimen when reducing S. magnifolium to a variety of S. stelligerum Sm., thereby confirming that this was the specimen used by Mueller to erect his species. Symon (1981) chose as lectotype of S. dallachii one of the sheets at K. Furthermore, he cited three MEL sheets as isolectotypes. While the sheet MEL 11655 and its duplicate (MEL 11659) may well be isolectotypes, the sheet MEL 11656 certainly is not as its label clearly shows that the date and locality of collection are different. Mueller (1867-1868) included a taxon he identified as S. repandum, clearly referring to the species described by Forster (S. repandum G. Forst., a member of the Lasiocarpa clade). His description of S. ‘repandum’ was based on 3 collections made by Dallachy in 1864. One of these specimens has a label that states the plant is “12 feet high” and has “fruits yellow”. Mueller repeats these statements in his description. Another specimen has a strip of bark taken from an older stem that bears numerous short prickles. The leafy specimen is without prickles. Mueller in his description, states that the branchlets of S. ‘repandum’ are on one part conspicuously aculeate, in another part without prickles. Bentham named S. dallachii in December 1868 based on these same specimens. Conservation status: Although not seen in the Ingham-Cardwell area (the type locality) for 130 years, S. magnifolium appears to be moderately common further north, particularly around Bloomfield.

Sterile specimens of S. stupefactum are very similar to S. densevestitum, particularly in leaf size, shape and indumentum, but S. stupefactum is a more robust plant with prickly stems and petioles. Etymology: The epithet is derived from Latin stupefactus, to be stunned, relating to the surprise and astonishment at finding such a species in southern Queensland."
wfo-0001030877,"Solanum rixosum is related to S. furfuraceum, but differs by the thin, non-descript bark; the stellae of the upper leaf surface very sparse to sparse; the fruiting pedicels 17-26 mm long (vs. 4-8 mm long for S. furfuraceum); the ovary with both stellate and very short, gland-tipped hairs; the calyx without very short, gland-tipped hairs, and the fruiting exocarp 0.9-1.2 mm thick (2-2.6 mm thick for S. furfuraceum). Solanum rixosum differs from S. magnifolium by the larger stellae with a relatively shorter central ray, stellae stalked on the lower leaf surface, adult leaves (when lobed) with only 1-3 pairs of lobes, the thinner exocarp of the fruit and the broadly ovate juvenile leaves."
wfo-0001027944,"Solanum fervens is closely related to S. discolor, but differs by the dense indumentum on the leaf underside (very dense for S. discolor), the stellate hairs of the calyx and leaf underside having a much longer central ray, the longer hypanthium, the stellate pubescent ovary (glabrous for S. discolor), and the exocarp ca. 0.8 mm thick (0.4-0.5 mm thick for S. discolor). Etymology: From the Latin fervens, meaning “burning, boiling, hot”. This is in reference to the high temperatures experienced by the species in the extreme north of Australia."
wfo-0001027447,"Solanum defensum is related to S. discolor, S. yirrkalense and S. fervens, but differs from all these species by the green lower leaf surface (stellate hairs absent to sparse), the midpoint of the stellae on the calyx only 0-0.5 times as long as lateral rays, and the thicker fruiting exocarp. Sterile specimens of S. defensum are readily confused with S. macoorai. These species are, however, allopatric."
wfo-0001027646,"Solanum dryanderense is closely related to S. shirleyanum, but differs by the larger stellae of the calyx and branchlets, the stellae of the lower leaf surface with stalks 0.15-0.25 mm long (sessile for S. shirleyanum), calyx stellae c. 0.4 mm diameter (0.15-0.25 mm diameter for S. shirleyanum) and seeds 3.5-4 mm long (2.6-3 mm long for S. shirleyanum). "
wfo-0001028059,"Solanum furfuraceum and S. sporadotrichum are notable for their corky bark, very conspicuous on adult plants, but usually visible even on herbarium specimens. Solanum furfuraceum forms a handsome shrub with its yellowish bark and often abundant purple flowers. A specimen labelled “East Coast” in BM (BM000596883) is possibly also isotype material."
wfo-0001028546,"According to Bean (2004), this species is closely related to S. dysprosium (see notes under that species). It is less closely related to S. semiarmatum, with which it shares the deeply lobed juvenile leaves, dense prickles on stems of juvenile plants, and the succulent 1-locular fruit. "
wfo-0001029244,"Solanum macoorai is closely related to S. magnifolium, but differs by the juvenile plants with longer and more abundant prickles; adult leaves usually lobed and bearing prickles, and with sparser indumentum on the lower surface; the stellae (on all organs) with a much shorter central ray, and stellae of the lower leaf surface lacking a central ray; and fruits red or orange at maturity (vs. yellow) (Bean, 2004). However, Bohs (unpub. data from Bohs & Sperry 3586, UT) collected a specimen on Mt. Bartle Frere with yellow mature fruits that keys out to S. macoorai, so more variation than previous recorded in fruit color may be present in this species. According to Symon (1981), there is great morphological variation between juvenile and adult phases of this species; the lower main stem may be spectacularly prickly. Symon (1981) counted (69-) 119 (-178) seeds in 8 different fruits. "
wfo-0001028025,"Solanum francisii is related to S. sporadotrichum, but differs by: the bark non-corky, except at the base of large plants; the longer and wider leaves with acute lobes; smaller stellae on all plant parts; inner surface of corolla sparsely stellate-hairy; calyx prickles usually present; and calyx with very short, gland-tipped hairs. Conservation status: S. francisii is known only from a small section of the Eungella National Park and an adjacent State Forest. It is threatened by low population size and weeds (especially Lantana camara). Applying the IUCN guidelines (IUCN, 2001), a category of “Vulnerable” is recommended (VU B1ab(iii,v)+2ab(iii,v); C1+2a(i); D1). Etymology: Named for W.D. Francis (1889-1959), the first collector of the species. Mr. Francis was the author of the well known book “Rainforest Trees of Australia”, and was for a time the Director of the Queensland Herbarium."
wfo-0001027735,"Solanum dysprosium is closely related to S. inaequilaterum, but differs by the smaller leaves, petioles 20-35% of lamina length, and bearing prickles (petioles 10-22%, without prickles for S. inaequilaterum), stellae on lower leaf surface 0.5-0.8 mm diameter (0.3-0.5 mm diameter for S. inaequilaterum), common peduncle present (absent for S. inaequilaterum), calyx lobes 2-3.5 mm long (4-9 mm for S. inaequilaterum). "
wfo-1000020805,"Capsicum longifolium is strongly resolved within the Andean clade. It is unique in the genus in having the longest and narrowest leaves and striking calyx appendages that arise from the calyx tube as laterally compressed thick expansions or wings. Variation in corolla colour and length of the fruiting calyx appendages can be observed in the field in individuals growing under the same environmental conditions. The corolla is usually entirely yellow, but occasional plants have corolla lobes that are red- to brown-edged or have a red-brown ring within the corolla throat; in this latter case, the filaments and the style are also red-brown. In general, the calyx appendages do not enlarge considerably in fruit, but some specimens have long appendages. Capsicum longifolium is morphologically most similar to C. dimorphum, its sister species and to C. regale with which it shares the stellate yellow corollas, the non-pungent fruits and the black seeds. Capsicum longifolium can be distinguished from C. dimorphum by having completely glabrous vegetative organs and calyces, long and narrow (ratio 6–10.8), coriaceous, major leaves, flowers 3–7 (–9) on a short rachis and calyces with 2–3 thick triangular-compressed appendages that look like wings. In contrast, C. dimorphum has pubescent vegetative organs and calyces, shorter and wider (ratio 4–5.25), membranous, major leaves, solitary or up to five axillary flowers and no calyx appendages or, if appendages are present, they are three and minute. Capsicum regale differs from C. longifolium in its occasionally forked inflorescence (vs. unbranched in C. longifolium), elliptic (vs. narrowly elliptic) major leaves, dark purple pedicels in fruit (vs. green) and purple (vs. orange) berries. Another species of Capsicum sympatric with C. longifolium (especially in SFBR, Ecuador) is C. geminifolium; that species has a dense indumentum, long-acuminate leaves, thin calyx appendages and campanulate yellow corollas with many purple or maroon spots within."
wfo-0001020215,"Capsicum rhomboideum belongs to the Andean clade. This species is one of the most polymorphic and widespread and has the largest synonymy of all the wild species of Capsicum. Capsicum rhomboideum is distinctive by its habit (shrubs or trees up to 5 m tall), the dark brown or brownish-purple bark with abundant lenticels, inflorescences up to 13-flowered, campanulate or campanulate-rotate yellow corollas, relatively small (5–9 mm in diameter) bright red turning dark burgundy non-pungent fruits, small dark brown seeds (2.4–2.8 mm long) and a mixture of simple and branched pubescence. While the reproductive characters are usually consistent along its wide distribution, the pubescence and leaf shape are the most variable features in C. rhomboideum, this variation being responsible for the many different names given to this species. Some populations are densely pubescent with only simple eglandular trichomes or with both simple and branched trichomes, while others vary from moderately pubescent to glabrescent (a few, completely glabrous). Simple eglandular trichomes range from 3–8 (–11) cells, whereas branched trichomes can be furcate or variously 3–5 (or more)-branched (many branches in different directions). Highly branched trichomes are uncommon in the genus, this character also occurring in a few Brazilian species (e.g. C. longidentatum, C. parviflorum). Leaf shape ranges from ovate, elliptic to rhomboid-ovate and, in some cases, the dissimilarity in size of the leaf pair is not obvious."
wfo-0001020147,"Capsicum longidentatum is unique and easily recognisable by its dense, branched indumentum (furcate and dendritic trichomes on young stems, leaves, pedicels and calyces) and the longest linear calyx appendages in the genus, reaching 8.5 mm in length. The mature fruits are non-pungent. Capsicum longidentatum is distinguishable from C. parvifolium and C. caatingae, the other members of the Caatinga clade, in its long calyx appendages (4.5–8.5 mm long), white corolla with greenish-yellow spots within, densely branched pubescence (though furcate or dendritic trichomes appear occasionally in C. caatingae and C. parvifolium, respectively) and non-pungent fruits. Capsicum caatingae and C. parvifolium have corollas mostly purple, usually simple pubescence and pungent fruits. Capsicum caatingae lacks of calyx appendages (vs. five, rarely six, in C. longidentatum) and has arborescent habit and multi-flowered inflorescences (vs. shrubby habit and few-flowered inflorescences in C. longidentatum), while C. parvifolium has similar habit and inflorescences as C. longidentatum, but the 5 (–7) calyx appendages are shorter (0.7–2.2 mm long)."
wfo-0001027416,"Solanum davisense resembles its widespread relative, S. citrullifolium, but differs in its more erect habit, more deeply dissected, acutely lobed leaves, smaller flowers and smooth, unridged seeds. It has a much simpler flavonoid profile and allozyme evidence shows that when it grows sympatrically with S. citrullifolium it is genetically distinct.
"
wfo-0001030883,"Solanum robustifrons was originally placed in section Polybotryon (correctly Pteroidea) by Bitter, who thought it was closely related to S. anceps and its allies (Knapp & Helgason, 1997). Solanum robustifrons differs from members of that section in its difoliate sympodial units, leaf-opposed inflorescences, and globose fruits. The superficial similarity lies in the fleshiness of the plant, most probably a result of its shady, moist habitat. Solanum robustifrons is most closely related to S. heleonastes of the swamps along the Río Paraná and eastern Bolivia. It shares with that species long-acuminate calyx lobes, deflexed flowering pedicels and erect fruiting pedicels, and small flowers compared to the other members of the group. Some collections of S. robustifrons have portions of a fleshy rhizomatous rootstock attached. The rhizomatous habit is unusual in section Geminata, and I have seen several populations of this species containing individuals of both rhizomatous and erect habits. Young plants have weak, fleshy stems, and easily topple over. Plants that topple when young may persist as rhizomatous individuals in these populations. The two forms of S. robustifrons differ only in their stature; they are otherwise identical. Solanum deflexiflorum (S. deflexiflorum species group) is a species of high elevations in Colombia and is not even closely related or superficially similar to S. robustifrons."
wfo-0001029059,"The flowers of S. leucocarpon are reminiscent of those of Cyphomandra (Solanum section Pachyphylla), and specimens have occasionally been identified as such. Flower size, calyx lobing, and size of the lobe apices varies somewhat throughout the range of S. leucocarpon, and leaf pubescence is enormously variable. Solanum leucocarpon is one of the most widespread and variable species in section Geminata. Found from Panama through the Amazon basin, its diverse pubescence and flower size forms have received many names. These somewhat distinctive local forms are treated here as unnamed geographical races, as intermediates in all variable characters exist. These races are briefly described below. 1) In northern South America and the Guianas, plants have large, fleshy flowers and are pubescent on the leaf undersides. The trichomes are long and slender, uniseriate, and either simple or branched, with both types usually occurring on a single leaf. The type specimens of S. leucocarpon, S. surimanense, and S. extraxillare come from among these populations. 2) In the area around Manaus and in the Rio Negro basin, populations of almost completely glabrous plants with somewhat smaller flowers are common. These plants have been called S. coarense.  3) Populations from the eastern (Peru and Ecuador) and southeastern (states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso) Amazon basin consist largely of plants with smaller flowers and shorter leaf pubescence. The leaf pubescence of plants from these populations is generally of tiny, erect, usually simple, uniseriate trichomes. Occasionally some longer trichomes like those of Guianan plants are found along the midrib on the leaf undersides. These plants have been called S. patellare.  4) Plants from the mountains of western Guyana have shiny, glabrous leaves and relatively small flowers. Very few collections exist from these glabrous populations. 5) Two extreme forms are found in Panama, both known from only one or two collections. Very pubescent plants from Darién province have been called S. eshbaughianum, and nearly glabrous ones from Isla de Coiba (Veraguas) have been called S. coibae. The fruiting pedicels of the glabrous Panamanian race are somewhat longer than those from other populations, but they have the distinctive distal swelling characteristic of S. leucocarpon.  Solanum leucocarpon is a shrub or small tree of secondary habitats, and is rarely found in the primary forest. In the Guianas it grows along forest edges in savannah, as well in many other types of secondary or highly disturbed habitats. This is one of the few species of section Geminata that I have seen only in secondary habitats and is also one of the most commonly collected species in the section. Specimens cited as Solanum brevipedunculatum by Cabrera (1978) from Jujuy province, Argentina may be members of Solanum section Cyphomandropsis Bitter. Members of this section share elongate, pointed buds with the S. leucocarpon group, but have elongate inflorescences with widely and unevenly spaced pedicel scars and brightly colored, few-seeded fruits. Section Cyphomandropsis is well developed in drier areas in eastern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina and has been monographed by Bohs (2001)."
wfo-0001027155,"Solanum comitis is a distinctive species, with dense pubescence of multangulate trichomes that dries with a whitish grey tinge. It is superficially similar to the western Australian S. lasiophyllum Dunal with dense whitish grey pubescence but differs from that species in its smaller flowers that are probably all hermaphroditic, smaller berries and completely different habitat (tropical versus dry and seasonal). Its relationships are not known, but in the inflorescence, flower and fruit morphology S. comitis resembles members of the Torva clade that occur in the Asian tropics (e.g., S. poka, S. pseudosaponaceum) and we suspect it is a member of that group. Re-collection of this species is a priority."
wfo-1000029963,"Doselia huilensis differs from all other Doselia species in its tubularcampanulate corollas with fully exserted anthers. The species is densely pubescent throughout, which is useful in distinguishing it from other Doselia species that are either glabrescent or less densely pubescent."
wfo-1000029961,"Doselia epifita is the only species of Doselia that reaches Ecuador and has the lowest elevational range within the genus. Doselia epifita is morphologically most similar to D. galilensis, and a detailed comparison is presented under the latter. The inflorescence morphology of D. epifita was unknown until recently because no complete specimens with entire inflorescences were known when the species was first described. Recent collections have revealed that the inflorescences are axillary and long (18.5–45 cm long). The fruits of this species remain unknown. The specific epithet refers to the apparent epiphytic habit of the species, though, like other species in the genus, D. epifita is a hemiepiphyte rather than an obligate epiphyte."
wfo-1000029962,"Doselia galilensis can be easily differentiated from other species of Doselia in its glabrescent mature leaf blades where pubescence is sparse and restricted to midveins and margins. Doselia galilensis is morphologically most similar to D. epifita; both species share several characters that are not present in other species of Doselia, such as infundibuliform corollas and included stamens with very short filaments. Unlike D. epifita, D. galilensis is sparsely pubescent, with only a few trichomes along the main veins of the leaves and very few trichomes in other parts of the plant. In contrast, D. epifita has a dense and persistent pubescence covering the entire plant with persistent trichomes on both sides of the leaves. The calyx lobes in D. galilensis are flat and lanceolate compared to the long-triangular undulate calyx lobes in D. epifita. Doselia galilensis has slightly larger corollas with greenish-white tubes and purple-tinged lobes on the abaxial side compared to D. epifita with white to purplish corolla tubes with purple lobes on both surfaces. Styles are consistently pubescent in D. galilensis along their entire length, while D. epifita has glabrous styles except for a few simple uniseriate trichomes at the very base.The epithet “galilensis” is in honour of the recently created “Parque Natural Regional Bosque de Galilea”, where the type specimen was collected. In the area of Arcabuco, Boyacá, D. galilensis is sympatric with Merinthopodium vogelii (Cuatrec.) Castillo & R.E.Schult., a vegetatively similar species of Solandreae. Merinthopodium vogelii differs in having green campanulate corollas with strongly reflexed lobes at anthesis and partially exserted anthers, while D. galilensis has included anthers and to greenish-white, infundibuliform corollas with slightly reflexed lobes that are purple-tinged at anthesis."
wfo-1000029964,"Doselia lopezii is the type species of the genus and the easiest species to recognise on account of its showy flowers with large orange corollas. Doselia lopezii has anomalous and apparently unique pollen in the genus with prominent spiny supratectal processes (Persson et al. 1994). Preliminary observations in D. huilensis (Orejuela et al. 2014) and specimens of D. epifita examined by Hunziker (1997, as M. lopezii) indicate that the pollen of these two species lack these spiny supratectal processes."
wfo-0001029645,"This species closely resembles S. allophyllum, but S. morellifolium has much smaller inflorescences, flowers, and fruits. The lobed leaves often seen in S. allophyllum apparently do not occur in this species. Although most collections are nearly glabrous, a few have glandular-puberulent inflorescence axes like those of S. mapiriense. The specific epithet refers to the great similarity of the leaves of this species to those of Solanum sect. Solanum, which was formerly known as Morella or Maurella until the name was changed to sect. Solanum in accordance of the rules of botanical nomenclature (Seithe, 1962). Data from Knapp & Mallet 6642 indicate that Ithomiine butterflies of the genus Thyridia oviposit on S. morellifolium. With this exception, all the known larval food plants for Thyridia belong to Solanum section Pachyphylla (the former genus Cyphomandra; Drummond, 1986). If S. morellifolium indeed turns out to be a food source for these butterfly larvae, it may be indicative of a closer chemical similarity between these taxa than would be inferred from their phylogenetic distance."
wfo-0001025845,"Solanum allophyllum differs from the other species of Solanum section Allophyllum by its large, ellipsoidal fruits and frequently pinnately lobed leaves. Solanum allophyllum usually bears both entire and pinnately lobed leaves on the same plant. Like the other species in section Allophyllum, the vegetative parts of the plant are marked with small white spots or lines that are apparently due to the accumulation of crystal sand in the tissues. The unlobed leaves are very similar in size and shape to those of S. morellifolium. The flowers of S. allophyllum, though rather large like those of S. mapiriense, are rotate-stellate with short lobes like those of S. morellifolium. Details of the architecture, branching pattern, compatibility, and cytology of S. allophyllum may be found in Bohs (1989). Solanum allophyllum may be a perennial herb that appears under favorable climatic conditions and dies back to the ground during dry spells. It is one of the few non-spiny Solanum species adapted to dry areas. The whitish, striped, and longitudinally compressed fruits are unique in the genus. When ripe, they are very sweet-smelling. Dispersal agents are unknown.
"
wfo-0001030145,"This species is known only from two to three collections from eastern Brazil. It is a diminutive species, probably a small shrub under 2 m tall with leaves apparently less than 7 cm long. The lower leaves are ternately compound and the entire plant is covered with dense, mostly glandular pubescence. Solanum ovum-fringillae may have affinities with other Brazilian species such as S. diploconos and S. sciadostylis. Although it is difficult to ascertain the precise structure of the flowers from the scanty material available, the stamens appear to be curved and appressed to the style and the connectives extend beyond the bases of the thecae but are shorter than the thecae at the apices. This anther morphology suggests a relationship with the Brazilian members of the S. diploconos clade such as S. sciadostylis, S. diploconos, S. latiflorum, S. pinetorum, and S. corymbiflorum (Bohs, in press b). Efforts should be made to collect additional representatives of this species."
wfo-0001029364,"This species differs from the others of the section by its large elliptic leaves and relatively large stellate corollas with long lobes. The fruits are small and globose like those of S. morellifolium. Thus far S. mapiriense has only been collected from a restricted area of western Bolivia. Although it is not possible to determine fruit shape from the herbarium specimens available, Rusby’s description mentions that the fruits of S. mapiriense are slightly depressed and have two grooves. Laterally compressed fruits may therefore be characteristic of this species as well as of S. allophyllum.  "
wfo-0001028021,"Solanum fragile is morphologically similar to the sympatric S. grandidentatum. Both are glandular-pubescent plants with incised, shallowly lobed leaves and green berries. Solanum fragile differs from S. grandidentatum in its possession of a woody rootstock with brittle stems (herbarium specimens are often only of the single stems that break off); S. grandidentatum is a shrubby plant with conspicuous aboveground branching. In live plants in the field, leaves of S. fragile, although glandular-pubescent, are odourless, but those of S. grandidentatum have a strong odour; leaf bases of S. fragile are truncate, while those of S. grandidentatum are more attenuate. Although the stamens of these two species are similar, the ratio of anthers to filaments is markedly different; S. fragile has anthers 2.5–3 mm long and filaments ca. 0.5 mm long, while S. grandidentatum has anthers 2–2.5 mm long and filaments 1–1.2 mm long."
wfo-0001029074,"The leaf upper surfaces of Solanum lignescens usually have a mixture of simple and stellate trichomes, and a given individual may have a mixture of types or have only simple trichomes adaxially. Due to the presence of intermediate hair types between simple and stellate, it is likely that the simple trichomes represent cases where the rays have been lost. Stellate trichomes always have a uniseriate, often unicellular stalk.The presence of these hairs and the shrubby habit make S. lignescens easily recognizable from the simple-haired, herbaceous species that comprise the rest of section Gonatotrichum. Solanum lignescens appears to occur along the Pacific slope from Mexico to Nicaragua, and several collections have been made in dry forests in Honduras. It is to be expected in similar habitats in more areas of Guatemala and El Salvador."
wfo-0001429592,"Solanum hunzikeri was long recognised as distinct from other glandular-pubescent species in Argentina but has only recently been named when additional specimens allowed us to clarify its differences from the widespread and highly variable S. tweedieanum. Solanum hunzikeri can be distinguished from S. tweedieanum populations in similar high elevation areas in its strongly attenuate and winged leaf bases; those of S. tweedieanum are more truncate. The single collection we have seen of S. hunzikeri with mature fruit (Rodríguez 1421 from Salta) has the calyx not covering any part of the mature berry; berries of S. tweedieanum are tightly covered by the accrescent calyx for at least 50% of their length. Berries of S. tweedieanum are pale cream when ripe, while berry colour in S. hunzikeri is not known. "
wfo-0001031065,"Solanum savannarum could be confused with S. tenuissimum Sendtn. due to its general aspect, pubescence, and habit. The latter species also occurs in central Brazil, in the state of Goiás, although the taxon was not found in the Distrito Federal, even after intensive collecting (Ribeiro-Silva et al. 1996). Solanum tenuissimum, however, can be distinguished by its yellow anthers, and the globose, smaller fruits (to ca. 0.4 cm in diameter) with at most three seeds per fruit; S. savannarum is distinguishable by its green anthers and the ovoid, larger fruits that have a larger number of seeds (ca. 11).
"
wfo-0001026307,"Solanum arenicola can be easily distinguished from S. americanum Mill., the only other similar Morelloid species found in lowland Amazonia; it has larger anthers which are 3.0-3.2 mm long in S. arenicola as compared to the minute anthers <1.5 mm of S. americanum. Specimens without locality information can be easily confused with S. nigrescens M.Martens & Galeotti of Central and northern South America, S. aloysiifolium Dunal of middle to high elevation Argentina and Bolivia or S. subtusviolaceum Bitter of low to middle elevation Peru and Bolivia. Both S. arenicola and S. nigrescens have simple inflorescences, but S. arenicola differs in having longer anthers (3.0-3.2 mm) compared to S. nigrescens (1.5-2.2 mm) and in the possession of glandular hairs (S. nigrescens is eglandular). The anthers are similar in size and shape to those of S. aloysiifolium, but S. arenicola has simple inflorescences and glandular-tipped hairs, while S. aloysiifolium has branched inflorescences (sometimes many branched) and lacks glandular hairs. Solanum subtusviolaceum possesses the same dense, glandular-haired indumentum as S. arenicola, but differs from it in having inflorescences with the flowers clustered near the tips positioned opposite the leaves rather than arising along the internodes, longer calyx lobes (2-3 mm versus 0.2-0.5 mm), more rotate corollas lobed only halfway to the base, and less exerted styles (to a maximum of 1 mm versus exerted to 3 mm beyond the anther cone). Solanum arenicola is one of the few morelloids known from lowland humid forests in South America. Most morelloid species grow > 2,000 m or in drier habitats along the western slope of the Andes or in the inter-Andean valleys, whilst S. arenicola is restricted to humid forests on the eastern side of the Andes below 1,200 m elevation. Currently, the species is known from central and southern Peru and from Bolivia, but it is likely that the species also occurs in adjacent areas of Brazil in the state of Rond&ocirc;nia, where the Río Madre de Dios and Río Beni join and cross the Brazilian border, especially considering habitat preferences of S. arenicola for disturbed, sandy soils along river banks.
"
wfo-0001028353,"Solanum herculeum, although quite rare globally, is a plant of disturbed situations in southern Spain. Its relationships to the two Macaronesian endemics, S. nava and S. trisectum, has long been recognised ( Francisco-Ortega et al. 1993). Solanum herculeum was distinguished from those species by Francisco-Ortega et al. (1993) by the abscence of horns on the anthers, but it is clear that anther horns (or callus) do occur on this species, but they are apical and much smaller than those of either S. nava or S. trisectum. The anthers of S. herculeum are tightly connivent, as are most other species of Solanum (with notable exceptions) and form a distinct anther cone. The corolla is strongly campanulate and zygomorphic; flowers are visited by large bees and buzzed as are other Solanum flowers (S. Knapp observations in Andalucia, March 2005). The fruits and seeds of Solanum herculeum are distinctive within Solanum; the thin pericarp that turns paper is also found in some species of the tomato clade (S. sitiens), but the seeds of S. herculeum are very large and have elongate, distinctive testal cell walls (Figure 3 of Francisco-Ortega et al. 1993)."
wfo-0001027235,"Solanum cordicitum has an overlapping geographic distribution with various members of section Androceras, including S. rostratum, S. davisense, both varieties of S. tenuipes, and S. citrullifolium vars. citrullifolium and setigerum. Unlike any of these species, S. cordicitum has white corollas. Additionally, S. cordicitum differs from S. rostratum in that the latter has stellate hairs on the stem while those of S. cordicitum are simple. Solanum tenuipes is typically found further south in the Big Bend area of Texas and is a perennial whereas S. cordicitum is an annual. The leaves of S. cordicitum are not thrice pinnatifid as they are in S. davisense and the lowermost anthers of the latter are shorter (6-8 mm in S. davisense versus 9-11 mm in S. cordicitum). Solanum cordicitum also has longer inflorescences than S. davisense (8-12 cm in S. cordicitum versus 4-7 cm in S. davisense) and larger flowers (2-2.5 cm in diameter in S. cordicitum versus 1.3-2 cm in S. davisense). The prickles of S. cordicitum are more widely spaced (<20 per cm) than those of S. citrullifolium var. setigerum (>30 per cm). The flowers of S. cordicitum are generally smaller (2-2.5 cm in diameter) than those of S. citrullifolium var. setigerum (2.5-3.5 cm in diameter). The epithet for Solanum cordicitumwas taken from the Latin cordicitus for from the heart referring to the type locality of Valentine, Texas.
"
wfo-0001031880,"Solanum trisectum is an extremely rare plant, and was thought to be extinct until collected in 1991 in the laurel forests of northern part of Madeira (Short, 1994). Considered by Dunal (1852) as a member of his subsection Tuberarium (potatoes and relatives), S. trisectum and its close relative S. nava of the Canary Islands were considered as a distinct section of Solanum by Bitter (1912, 1917). Francisco-Ortega et al. (1993) recognised these two species as the genus Normania, differentiated from Solanum on the basis of the horned anthers, zygomorphic flowers, and distinct seed and pollen morphology. Molecular studies indicate that these species (and their close relative S. herculeum, previously recognised as the genus Triguera) form a distinct clade within a larger, monophyletic Solanum (Bohs & Olmstead, 2001). Solanum trisectum can be distinguished from S. nava by its 3-foliate leaves, its more densely glandular parts and its yellow anthers with horns about one-third of the way from the base. "
wfo-0001022276,"Lycianthes ceratocalycia was rarely collected until the 21st century. It can be distinguished from similar species with stellate corollas and equal stamens by the scurfy horizontal lines on the young stems.
"
wfo-0001022333,"Lycianthes gongylodes is known from only four collections that we know of, all collected prior to 1970 by Breedlove, Proctor, and Steyermark (Gentry, 1973; Gentry & Standley, 1974). It is most likely allied to Lycianthes heteroclita (Sendtn.) Bitter, which it shares green herbaceous stems that collapse upon drying. The form of the calyx in the two species is similar, although L. gongylodes differs in having small calyx appendages which make the calyx appear thicker and more bowl-shaped in flower and flat-bottomed in fruit (a feature it shares with Lycianthes connata J. L. Gentry). Lycianthes heteroclita usually lacks appendages on the calyx, which looks campanulate in flower and bowl-shaped to plate-like in fruit; in addition, it usually lacks obvious interpetalar tissue connecting the lobes of the corolla. The curly trichomes that are present on the stems and leaves of L. gongylodes are quite distinctive and different than the very small trichomes present in L. heteroclita; Lycianthes gongylodes lacks the tiny groups of white trichomes that appear like small granules on the calyx of L. heteroclita. Lycianthes gongylodes could also be confused with L. ceratocalycia,(Donn.Sm.) Bitter, another allied species that occurs in the same region of Guatemala and adjacent Mexico. Lycianthes ceratocalycia differs in having purple, stellate corollas with sparse interpetalar tissue and scurfy horizontal lines on the young branches. A sterile specimen of L. gongylodes could be misidentified as L. tricolor (Dun.) Bitter, something that was done in Dean et al. (2017), where Steyermark 49839 (a paratype of L. gongylodes) is cited under L. tricolor.
"
wfo-0001030265,"The name S. paucidens has not been in common use for this species, in part due to the poor quality of the type specimen (see below). Earlier treatments either treated this species as new (e.g., as S. maioranthum) or as S. nigrescens, a species from North, Central and northern South America. The flowers of S. paucidens are usually evenly spaced along the elongate inflorescence axis, in contrast to S. nigrescens where they are clustered at the tip or not widely spaced. Solanum paucidens is most similar to S. enantiophyllanthum, with which it is nearly sympatric in the mountain ranges of southern Brazil. Solanum paucidens has smaller flowers (0.8–1.2 cm in diameter versus 1.9–2 cm in diameter) with shorter anthers (2.5–3.5 mm long versus 4.5–6 mm long) than S. enantiophyllanthum and grows at somewhat lower elevations where their distributions overlap. In herbarium specimens the inflorescences of S. paucidens appear secund, with flowers and fruits on one side of the inflorescence axis; this is most easily seen in fruiting specimens."
wfo-0001030581,"Solanum pseudoamericanum can be distinguished from the similar S. americanum by the following suite of characters; berries that are matte or somewhat shiny at maturity, versus very shiny in S. americanum, styles that are always exserted to approximately equal to the length of the anther cone, versus styles almost included in the anther cone in S. americanum and the globose, bright green stigmas, versus a white or pale green stigmas that are merely a widening of the style tip in S. americanum. Solanum pseudoamericanum usually occurs above 2,000 m elevation, with only some overlap between the closely related S. americanum that occurs from sea level to 2,200 m in elevation. Other members of the Morelloid clade in Peru without glandular trichomes which grow sympatrically with S. pseudoamericanum differ from it in being larger in growth form (reaching up to 2 m in height), having larger, violet flowers and fruits that are green at maturity (S. cochabambense, S. interandinum), or being smaller herbs up to 30 cm high with similarly sized flowers but red, orange or yellow berries (S. corymbosum, S. palitans, S. radicans). Solanum longifilamentum is somewhat similar to S. pseudoamericanum but has longer anthers (2–3.4 mm long versus 1–1.5 mm long) and more ellipsoid buds.
	
"
wfo-0001022221,"This species is similar to the Central American species L. synanthera (Sendtn.) Bitter in having pale woody stems with petioles that darken upon drying, in having tufts of trichomes in the vein axils of the abaxial side of the leaf, and in having fused anthers that dehisce by slits formed between adjacent thecae. It differs from that species in having connate, reflexed appendages on the calyx (versus no appendages in L. synanthera), and purple fruits (versus yellow/orange fruits in L. synanthera). Reyes-Cornejo (2015) indicated that this species is also found in Central America, and there are difficult to identify specimens from Costa Rica and Panama that resemble L. synanthera but have calyx appendages. These specimens need further study.
"
wfo-0001022330,"Lycianthes geminiflora is a large herb to treelet, usually found in cloud forest on slopes. It is very similar to Lycianthes heteroclita (Sendtn.) Bitter, with which it can overlap in distribution. The two species differ in the size of the flowering calyx, with that of L. geminiflora 1.5 mm long or less, and that of L. heteroclita usually 2 mm long or more.
"
wfo-0001022346,"Lycianthes heteroclita is one of the most common and wide-ranging Lycianthes species in Mexico and Central America. It's lifeform ranges from a large herb growing epiphytically or on the ground to a treelet, becoming woody at the base. When pressed, its herbaceous stems compress at the nodes. The variability in the flowers of this species deserves more study. From Mexico to Nicaragua, the corolla is usually white on the adaxial side and deeply stellate with very little interpetiolar tissue. However, populations with corollas with more interpetiolar tissue at the base of the lobes have been observed and collected in Mexico (Chiapas), Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua; this form of the corolla may be stellate only halfway to the base. In Costa Rica and Panama, the corollas are usually deeply stellate and purple on the adaxial side; this form was first described as Solanum mitratum Greenman (equal to Lycianthes mitrata (Greenm.) Bitter) and later by Georg Bitter as Lycianthes heteroclita var. gracilis Bitter. Further study may show that these flower variants are geographically distinct and deserve recognition at the species level. In Mexico, Lycianthes heteroclita is sometimes confused with the Mexican endemic L. geminiflora (M. Martens & Galeotti) Bitter. In general, the two species can be separated by flowering calyx size, with that of L. heteroclita usually equal to or greater than 2 mm in length and that of L. geminiflora usually up to 1.5 mm in length. Also, L. heteroclita is usually found at lower elevations than L. geminiflora, which is a high-elevation cloud forest species, but the two species do co-occur in Oaxaca and Veracruz. In the areas of overlap, L. heteroclita is usually found below 1000 m, while L. geminiflora is usually found above 800 m. In addition, L. heteroclita specimens have been collected in Guatemala at elevations of 2000 m or more, which is unusual. In Chiapas, Honduras and Costa Rica, there are many specimens collected from elevations between 1200 and 1700 m, as well as elevations below 1000 m. Where they co-occur, Lycianthes heteroclita may be confused with L. synanthera and L. nitida Bitter, because all three species have calyces lacking appendages and may be epiphytic. Both L. synanthera and L. nitida have woody upper stems that do not collapse at the nodes upon drying. In addition, L. synanthera usually has hairs in the axils of the primary veins on the abaxial leaf surface, while L. nitida has coriaceous leaves with geminate pairs in which the smaller of the pair is much smaller in size and more rounded than the larger leaf.
"
wfo-0001027452,"Solanum deflexum and S. lignescens are the only two species in the section that occur in Central America. The straight, multicelled, unbranched hairs of S. deflexum are unlike the hairs of S. hoffmanseggii, S. olympicum, and S. turneroides that bend up or down the stem, and unlike S. lignescens the hairs are not stellate. Solanum lignescens is sympatric with S. deflexum but the latter is a diminutive plant, reaching 30 to rarely 40 cm in height and unlike S. lignescens is not woody. The plants are frequently many branched at the base, creating a flat appearance that is distinct from the upright appearance of other members of the clade. Solanum deflexum is also unique in that the first inflorescence often appears with the first pair of leaves after the cotyledons, giving the appearance of flowering while still a seedling (Nee 1989). The seeds of S. deflexum have a pronounced notch where they attach to the placenta and the outer margin of the seeds is swollen. The flowers of S. deflexum reach 1 cm in diameter and are therefore much smaller than those of S. turneroides. The anthers are all equal in length, unlike the slightly heterantherous S. olympicum and the strongly heterantherous S. turneroides and S. evolvuloides. Unlike other members of the clade, S. deflexum is rarely rhizomatous, although it does appear in patches, likely due to the explosive dehiscence of the fruits. From greenhouse observations, the fruits of S. deflexum do not appear to have as great a pressure buildup as those of S. olympicum or S. turneroides and therefore do not seem to have the same dispersal abilities. The leaves of S. deflexum are moderately to densely pubescent, in contrast to those S. manabiense, which are nearly glabrous."
wfo-0001030081,"Solanum olympicum is the one of the two members of section Gonatotrichum, along with S. hoffmanseggii, with characteristic geniculate hairs. These hairs always bend between the first and second cells and point upwards. This trait is absent in some specimens from the northern extent of the species' range in Bahia and Goiás, Brazil (including Arbo et al. 5613, Alvarenga et al. 1295, Mello-Silva 2286, and Silva et al. 4860). These specimens are disjunct in their distribution and have a mixture of hairs that are held perpendicular to the stem (similar in orientation but shorter than those of S. deflexum) and hairs that are adpressed and lie flat along the stem. However, other morphological characteristics of these specimens correspond to the concept of S. olympicum, and molecular phylogenies place one of these Bahian specimens as sister to the other populations of S. olympicum. One specimen from Mato Grosso do Sul, Hatschbach et al. 76267, has a shrubby habit with a mixture of geniculate and glandular hairs. This might represent a new species or simply a shrubby example of S. olympicum; however, since it is only represented by one specimen at this time we have chosen to treat it as S. olympicum. The geniculate hairs of S. olympicum are shared with S. hoffmanseggii of Pará state in northern Brazil. These species can be distinguished by the narrow, lanceolate leaves and shrubby habit of S. hoffmanseggii compared with the elliptic to elliptic-ovoid leaves and herbaceous habit of S. olympicum. The seed coats of S. olympicum are unique in the section in having raised fibrils that radiate from the center to the margins of the seeds. The flowers of S. olympicum are weakly heterantherous with one filament slightly elongated, which is typically only visible in living plants. The flowers are distinct from those of the strongly heterantherous S. turneroides and S. evolvuloides because they are much smaller. Solanum olympicum also resembles S. adscendens, but the latter species has cordate leaves, a more branched, spreading growth form, and is restricted to Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and neighboring parts of Argentina. The Bahian collections of S. olympicum lack of glandular hairs on the stems and calyx, unlike S. evolvuloides, which has abundant glandular pubescence."
wfo-0001032167,"Strongly heterantherous flowers are only found in two members of the section, S. turneroides and S. evolvuloides. Solanum turneroides can be distinguished from S. evolvuloides by its lack of glandular hairs, its larger flowers, and its more widespread South American distribution. As noted by Nee (1989), the flowers of S. turneroides are not open in the heat of the day similar to those of S. evolvuloides (L. Giacomin, pers. obs.). When grown in the greenhouse at UT the flowers were open and very fragrant during the night and early morning. As the day gets warmer the flowers take on a wilted appearance. The pollinators of these flowers are unclear. Fragrance is unusual in the genus and is commonly only found in S. section Pachyphylla (Bohs 1994). The floral development is also of interest, with the stamens of equal length on the first day the flower is open and then the filament of the lowermost anther doubling in length the following day (Fig. 14C & D in Stern et al. 2013). The fruits of S. turneroides are larger than those of the other members of section Gonatotrichum. The fruit wall is greatly expanded distally and may be up to 1.5 mm thick. The weakest point, and the point of dehiscence, is between the calyx lobes at the proximal end of the fruit where a small slit opens and the seeds are squirted out. Like S. olympicum and S. deflexum, the plants are self compatible; however, S. turneroides is not autogamous. Although herbarium sheets rarely display the feature, S. turneroides seems to spread rhizomatously. The hairs of S. turneroides are also unique in the section. While they superficially appear to be geniculate, like those of S. olympicum and S. hoffmanseggii, closer inspection shows that the hairs are simply bent downward on the stem and lack the 90 degree elbow bend that characterizes the hairs of the latter two species. Using scanning electron microscopy, the base of these hairs appears to have a ring of small lateral cells, hinting that perhaps these hairs are reduced stellate hairs. If so, it may suggest that the simple hairs found in this and other species of section Gonatotrichum may represent evolutionary reductions from stellate hairs."
wfo-0001025754,"Solanum adscendens is restricted to Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil, with collections from the border of this and Santa Catarina State, and adjacent Corrientes and Misiones Provinces in Argentina. It is similar to S. olympicum and has been considered to be conspecific with it (Nee 1989). Mentz and Olivera (2004) also placed specimens of S. adscendens and S. olympicum together in the same species they called S. adscendens. This placement was largely due to the absence of type material as the presumed holotype was destroyed in Berlin and the photographs of it were not sufficient to distinguish the species. Mentz and Olivera's (2004) photographs of a type at Paris enabled us to readily distinguish S. adscendens from the more common and widespread S. olympicum. The cordate leaf bases, straight (not geniculate) hairs, glandular hairs on the abaxial leaf surface, and sprawling growth form with many branches from a single base characterize S. adscendens and differentiate it from S. olympicum. Molecular data clearly distinguish S. adscendens from the morphologically very similar species S. olympicum (Fig. 4 in Stern et al. 2013).
"
wfo-0001022289,"Lycianthes coffeifolia is a species of the humid low forest of northwest South America. It was placed in Lycianthes series Piliferae by Bitter (1919), due to its few-flowered inflorescences, shrub habit, simple trichomes, and stamens of equal length. However, it is probably not closely related to L. pilifera (Benth.) Bitter, L. quichensis (J.M.Coult.& Donn.Sm.) Bitter, and L. caeciliae Bitter, high-elevation cloud forest species of Mexico and Guatemala that make up the core part of that series (Dean et al. 2019). Lycianthes coffeifolia does resemble the lower elevation L. stephanocalyx (Brandegee) Bitter of Mexico and Central America, also placed in series Piliferae by Bitter (Dean et al. 2019); the two species share arching slender pedicels in flower and fruit, white stellate corollas, and connate/connivant yellow anthers. The unusual calyx of L. coffeifolia is similar in structure to that of L. connata J.L.Gentry of Mexico and Guatemala in having appendages that curve downward exposing a long rim (Dean et al. 2020). However, the close relatives of L. coffeifolia remain unknown.
"
wfo-0001030714,"Solanum pyrifolium is similar to the other members of the Dulcamaroid clade growing in the Caribbean, S. boldoense of Cuba and the widespread and often cultivated S. seaforthianum. It can be distinguished from those species by its inflorescence that is narrowly ob-ellipsoid in outline rather than globose or broadly ellipsoid, its entire leaves that are generally narrower than those of S. boldoense with a distinct submarginal vein (leaves of S. seaforthianum are usually pinnatifid) and quadrate calyx lobes with a distinctly thickened margin. Dried specimens of S. pyrifolium are a distinctive greenish grey color, rather than the more blackened or green specimens of the other two taxa. The articulation point on the pedicel of S. pyrifolium is always more basal than that of S. boldoense, but occasionally a short peg is left on the inflorescence axis at fruit or flower fall. Although Lamarck’s protologue indicates that the plant collected by Martin came from Martinique (“Martinica”), Solanum pyrifolium has never again been collected there. A similar situation exists for S. crotonoides (Leptostemonum clade), also collected by Martin from “Martinique”. I suspect that Martin did in fact also visit Hispaniola or that Martin (or those who labelled his collections back in Paris) used Martinique as a broad locality covering much of the Caribbean region (although other collections of his have labels stating “S. Domingo”), and that both these plants are true Hispaniolan endemics."
wfo-0001027661,"Solanum dulcamara is an extremely widespread species and shows high level of phenotypic plasticity. Some of the morphological variation in S. dulcamara appears to be related to habitat (e.g., coastal forms with succulent leaves that have been recognised as var. marinum and S. littorale) but much of the variation is in leaf size and division, pubescence and flower color; I have been able to find no pattern related to either geography or habitat in this variation. Turesson (1922) suggested that differences in morphology related to habitat were genetic, despite his finding that in non-coastal environments thick-leaved coastal forms developed thinner, less pubescent leaves. Sun and shade leaves of S. dulcamara have been studied for physiological and some morphological properties (Clough et al. 1979a, b). Differences in morphology can occur along a single stem depending upon the shade environment. A few of the more extreme morphological forms have been recognised at the species level, but the variation in the diagnostic features of these forms is continuous across the range of the species. Identifications of individual specimens by botanists describing these variants were occasionally inconsistent from duplicate to duplicate.	Plants occurring in the swampy areas around the hot springs at Lenkoran in what is now Azerbaijan were described as S. kieseritzkii; all of the collections from this locality are composed of small erect shoots connected with creeping stems and have very small inflorescences of only a few flowers. Glabrous plants with simple leaves have been recognised as S. pseudopersicum; glabrous plants with divided leaves as S. kitagawae. Pubescent plants with simple leaves were described as S. persicum; these tended to be from the southern part of the species range in Eurasia, but occur throughout the species' range. Large-fruited plants from the eastern margins of the Asian range have been called var. macrocarpum; these fruits also tend to be more ellipsoid than globose, but as with other characters, this occurs sporadically throughout the range of the species. Finally, white-flowered plants have been given varietal or subspecific status both in Europe and the United States; polymorphism in flower color is common in Solanum in general."

wfo-0001030867,"Morphologically, S. rigidum does not resemble any American species or species group of solanums, but it is more similar to African species of the Eggplant clade such as S. cerasiferum Dunal and S. campylacanthum A.Rich. in its greyish green leaves (Fig. 1A), violet flowers and spherical fruits with tough pericarp that is green-striped when immature (see Fig. 1 B) and yellow when ripe. Solanum rigidum differs from those species in its densely pubescent ovaries and long acuminate calyx lobes that are upturned in fruit (Fig. 1B). It shares with those taxa a strongly andromonoecious breeding system, with a single or few hermaphroditic flowers at the base of the inflorescence and the distal flowers with short styles and functioning as males. Andromonoecy is common in the spiny solanums (subgenus Leptostemonum Bitter) and is found in both New and Eastern Hemisphere species. Two other Solanum species occur on the Atlantic islands off the African coast (Macronesia): Solanum verspertilio Aiton and S. lidii Sunding, both from the Canary Islands. Both those species have strongly zygomorphic flowers with strongly unequal anthers while the flowers of S. rigidum are actinomorphic with anthers of equal size. Solanum rigidum has long been treated as S. fuscatum L. (Linnaeus 1762), and as an American introduction to the Cape Verde Islands, rather than the endemic species that it is. Use of the name S. fuscatum (proposed for rejection due to its inconsistent and complex usage since its first description, Knapp 2011; rejection supported by Committee on Vascular Plants [17 for, 0 against, 1 abstention], see Applequist 2012) began in the early 20th century with Chevalier's (1935: 904) treatment of the plants of the Cape Verde archipelago; he assumed that this spiny solanum species was an introduction from the Americas, presumably from Linnaeus' indication of origin of S. fuscatum, or Dunal's (1814) suggestion that his S. heteracanthum was similar to S. fuscatum, and that assumption has persisted in floristic work since that time. The discovery that S. rigidum is not an introduction from the Americas but instead an endemic species in the Cape Verde islands highlights the need for conservation assessment on the islands in order to determine its range and population sizes. Solanum rigidum occurs on both of the main island groups of the Cape Verdes, on São Vincente, São Nicolau and Boa Vista of the Ilheus de Barlovento, and on Maio, Santiago, Fogo and Brava of the southern Ilheus de Sotovento. Label data indicate S. rigidum occurs in disturbed habitats, often at the edges of washes and riverbeds, so it may be a weedy species despite its narrow geographic range and endemic status. Solanum rigidum is a member of the Eggplant clade, a large group of mostly East African taxa that includes the cultivated eggplant S. melongena L. Solanum rigidum may be of hybrid origin based on molecular data indicating plastid-nuclear discordance in its phylogenetic placement. The chromosome number of S. rigidum is not known, but S. campylacanthum is tetraploid in some parts of its range (see Knapp et al. 2013), while S. macrocarpon is diploid. The preliminary relationships based on molecular data may indicate hybrid origin, or introgression; further work on the cyotogenetics of all members of the Eggplant clade is a priority (see Knapp et al. 2013).

wfo-0001031697,"Because of the general aspect of the plant and the preponderance of derived simple hairs, S. tenuissimum is conspicuously anomalous among sect. Acanthophora, where it well merits its own subsection because of the very specialized fruit and seeds. There is no indication of the prominent wing of the species of subsect. Pterosperma although the general aspect and pubescence of S. tenuissimum might suggest a delicate miniature version of S. acerifolium or S. atropurpureum. Its seeds could easily be derived from the generalized seed structure of subsect. Euleptostemonum but among that group, most species are considerably more robust and pubescent as well as possessing larger flowers. It may be most closely related to S. stenandrum from the same geographical area and habitat, which has relatively few seeds per fruit and which has a generally similar pubescence. I know of no other species of Solanum with so few seeds. The lowest numbers otherwise known in sect. Acanthophora are in S. stenandrum which has from 33 to 80 seeds per fruit, and in S. affine which may have as few as 15 per fruit. Throughout this vast genus, large numbers of seeds per fruit are the rule and they usually number in the dozens if not hundreds."

wfo-0001028429,"Solanum hjertingii is most similar to S. stoloniferum but is distinguished by its curved styles generally long-exserted (2-8 mm) beyond the tip of the anther tube and glabrous to glabrescent leaves (Spooner et al. 2001). Solanum stoloniferum has straight styles exserted 2-4.5 mm beyond the tip of the anther tube, and strigose, puberulent, or pubescent leaves. Hawkes (1990) placed six species in ser. Longipedicellata: S. fendleri, S. hjertingii, S. matehualae, S. papita, S. polytrichon, and S. stoloniferum. The specimens Hawkes labeled as these names are all tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) and grow in the southeastern United States (Hawkes’s S. fendleri) and Mexico. Morphological data (Spooner et al. 2001) supported at best only three species in series Longipedicellata: 1) S. polytrichon, 2) S. hjertingii (including S. matehualae), and 3) S. stoloniferum (including S. fendleri and S. papita). Solanum polytrichon was supported as a species only by a canonical variate analysis, but not by a principal components analysis that intermixed S. polytrichon with many other species, and thus was the least supported species."

All other wild potato species from North and Central America have lunate stipules. The type sheet of S. jamesii bears two flowering specimens, one larger than the other; both comprise the holotype. Bitter (1913) created Solanum jamesii subsp. septentrionale by combining S. jamesii var. heterotrichium, S. jamesii var. sinclarii, and S. jamesii var. brachistotrichium into a single subspecies. Spooner et al. (2004) considered the first and second of these names to be synonyms of S. jamesii, and the third to be a synonym of S. stenophyllidium. Bitter designated no type for this new name, but cited only the three varietal names. The types of these names, therefore, become syntypes from which a lectotype was chosen. Records of S. jamesii from natural habitats in Colorado are limited to the extreme southwestern and southeastern parts of the state. Several disjunct populations from northern Colorado in Boulder and Larimer Counties and in Scottsbluff County Nebraska are near cultivated fields and greenhouses. Recent searches at these localities have been unsuccessful (Bamberg et al. 2003). These disjunct northern sites likely represent recent introductions to experimental stations."
wfo-0001032344,"Solanum verrucosum is very similar to some populations of S. stoloniferum and S. demissum. It is best distinguished by the corollas with the edges inrolled dorsally (see plates 3E, 9 of Spooner et al. 2004), but this is difficult to see on poorly prepared specimens.
Hawkes (1990) recognized S. vallis-mexici as a triploid nothospecies, formed by hybridization between S. stoloniferum and S. verrucosum. Spooner et al. (2004) had difficulty distinguishing S. vallis-mexici from S. stoloniferum using herbarium specimens, and poorly preserved specimens of S. verrucosum could also be confused with either of the above. Spooner et al. (2004) maintained this nothospecies based on some populations documented to be triploid and specimens with a generalized aspect similar to the type (see illustration in Fig. 52 of Spooner et al. (2004)."
wfo-0001031486,"Solanum stoloniferum is one of the most common, widespread, and polymorphic species of wild potatoes from North and Central America. It is very similar to some populations of S. demissum, S. hjertingii, and S. verrucosum. Solanum stoloniferum has pedicel articulation below the distal ¼ of the pedicel, flat corolla margins, and straight styles exserted only 0.4.5 mm beyond the tip of the anthers (Spooner et al. 2001). Solanum demissum has pedicel articulation in the upper ¼ of the pedicel, S. hjertingii has curved styles exserted 2-8 mm beyond the tip of the anthers, and S. verrucosum has corollas with the edges inrolled dorsally. Van den Berg et al. (2002) showed S. polytrichon to be completely intermixed with S. stoloniferum (including S. fendleri and S. papita) in an analysis of AFLP data. A reexamination by Spooner et al. (2004) of living accessions previously identified as S. polytrichon at Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin in 2001 showed putative diagnostic characters of spreading pubescence, enlarged terminal leaflets, and white corollas to vary tremendously in this species. For example, Graham 250, 256, 315, 358; Hawkes 1468; Ochoa 14178, possessed a clear expression of dense spreading pubescence, enlarged terminal leaflets, and white corollas. Other accessions, however, are impossible to clearly and consistently distinguish as S. polytrichon and were supported as species in the canonical variate analysis only by widely overlapping character states. For example, Tarn et al. 235, Rodríguez 2558, 2571; Spooner et al. 4109, have only few spreading hairs, and Tarn et al. 212 and Spooner et al. 4118 have purple corollas. Accessions identified as S. papita (Correll 20075 and Tarn et al. 114) have white corollas and spreading hairs. There is such an intergradation of these “species-specific” character as to make S. polytrichon untenable to recognize. There is a tendency for S. stoloniferum to be of shorter stature with fewer interjected leaves in the northern than in the southern part of its range, and these northern populations have been named S. fendleri. There are so many exceptions to these characters however (e.g., Blumer 1566, type of S. fendleri subsp. arizonicum, that is taller; or Blumer 1579 or Lemmon 2845 from Arizona with up to four sets of interjected leaflets) that height alone fails to distinguish these formerly recognized species. Solanum stoloniferum can easily be confused with some landraces of S. tuberosum. Solanum tuberosum often has wider leaflets and longer peduncles than S. stoloniferum, and some landraces have pink corollas (never pink in S. stoloniferum). Solanum tuberosum is so variable, however, (including cultivars with narrower leaflets, shorter peduncles, and white or blue or purple corollas; e.g., Mexia 2658 at E, RSA) that the two taxa may be impossible to distinguish consistently and reliably on herbarium sheets. Hawkes (1990) recognized S. ×vallis-mexici as a triploid nothospecies, formed by hybridization between S. stoloniferum and S. verrucosum. Spooner et al. (2004) had difficulty distinguishing herbarium specimens of S. ×vallis-mexici from S. stoloniferum, and poorly preserved specimens of S. verrucosum could also be confused with either of them. Spooner et al. (2004) maintained this nothospecies based on some populations documented to be triploid and specimens with a generalized aspect of S. ×vallis-mexici. Spooner et al. (2004) illustrated some of this variability in their Figs. 32 (the type of S. fendleri, illustrating a short plant with few lateral leaflets and an enlarged terminal leaf), Fig. 33 (the type of S. polytrichon, illustrating a densely pubescent plant with few lateral leaflets and enlarged terminal leaflet), and Fig. 34 (a common morphotype of S. stoloniferum, a taller plant with more, and subequal-sized lateral and terminal leaflets). Correll (1962) also was confounded by tremendous variation in S. stoloniferum, but recognized names Spooner et al. (2004) placed under S. stoloniferum and suggested even the need to segregate species from S. stoloniferum. This broad synonymy in S. stoloniferum runs counter to the supposition of Correll (1962: 374): “It is quite probable that when lengthy detailed field studies are made a different, more strict, interpretation of this species will result in the segregation of several rather well defined entities.” "
wfo-0001029121,"Solanum longiconicum, like all four species in the Conicibaccata group that occur in Mexico and Central America, is distinguished by conical fruits, leaves with a somewhat parallel-sided morphology, and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. It is distinguished from the other members of the group by its shiny, glabrous to subglabrous leaves, and seeds with a purple spot, caused by the purple embryo showing through the greenish seed coat.
"
wfo-0001028263,"Solanum guerreroense is known only from the type, a specimen grown from tubers collected in the wild from Mexico. Other herbarium specimens bearing this collection number at K and LL were collected later and are therefore not considered type material. Searches for S. guerreroense in 1988 (Spooner et al. 1991) and 1997 (Spooner et al. 2000) at the locality in Guerrero from which Correll obtained the tubers were unsuccessful. The type was collected in mature fruit in December; indicating S. guerreroense may flower and fruit from July to December, like other members of the Iopetala group. Correll (1952) described S. guerreroense as a low-growing plant (similar to some populations of S. demissum), with white corollas (like S. hougasii), and with conical fruits (like S. iopetalum). He cited two gatherings of this species, Correll 14410 (the source of the tubers in Guerrero from which the type was grown), and Hinton 11929 from Michoacán). Correll (1952) identified another collection, Correll 14342, as S. verrucosum var. spectabilis (=S. hougasii) that was later identified in the US Potato genebank as S. guerreroense. The morphological study of Spooner et al. (1995) showed material identified in genebanks as S. guerreroense, S. hougasii, and S. iopetalum (including S. brachycarpum), to be very difficult to separate into three taxa, but Correll 14342 clustered with other populations of S. hougasii. Solanum guerreroense is very similar to both S. iopetalum (with fewer interstitial and lateral leaflets), and S. hougasii (with globose fruits) (Spooner et al. 1995). Spooner et al. (2004) identified Correll’s (1952) paratype Hinton 11929 as S. hougasii. Solanum guerreroense may be a highly rare and endemic species very similar to and possibly conspecific with S. iopetalum. Lack of comparative material from the type locality confounds this decision."
wfo-0001025646,"Juzepczuk (1937) designated M. Antipovich 12 as “type” for S. vallis-mexici, and also listed M. Antipovich 14. There are two herbarium specimens at K, both bearing the label M. Antipovich 12 and 14, yet both of these sheets bear a single plant each. It is unclear how to interpret this ambiguity of two collector numbers on a single herbarium sheet with only one specimen, and Spooner et al. (2004) could not determine which of these is an isotype."
wfo-0001031400,"Solanum stenophyllidium is distinguished from S. jamesii which has pinnatifid pseudostipules (S. stenophyllidium with lunate pseudostipules). It is distinguished from S. cardiophyllum by its white corollas and longer calyx acumens up to 1 mm (cream colored corollas and minute calyx acumens less than 0.5 mm in S. cardiophyllum). It is distinguished from S. ehrenbergii by its leaflets that are linear, linear-lanceolate to lanceolate, with oblique bases (leaflets ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate, bases cordate, oblique or slightly truncate in S. ehrenbergii). Correll (1962: 280) was unable to locate the type of S. jamesii subsp. nayaritense and proposed the following “lectotype” (correctly a neotype): MEXICO: Nayarit: Tepic, Sierra Madre, near Santa Teresa, 9 Aug 1897, J. N. Rose 2134 (neotype: US-301039! [Correll neg. 137: BM!, GH!, K!, LL!, NY!, UC!, US!]. Spooner et al. (2004) found the holotype at P, invalidating his neotypification. Rydberg (1924) erred in his new combination Solanum brachistotrichum (correctly ‘brachistotrichium’) (Bitter) Rydberg, as is evident from his incorrect citation of the basionym S. jamesii brachistotrichum Bitter. Hawkes (1990: 79) noted this spelling change but incorrectly justified its maintenance based on established use by Hawkes (1956, 1963) and Correll (1952, 1962). Spooner et al. (2004) restored the correct spelling. Solanum stenophyllidium exhibits great variation in leaf size, leaflet shape, and indument length and density. Correll (1962) and Hawkes (1990) recognized S. brachistotrichium, S. nayaritense, and S. stenophyllidium as distinct species based on variation of these characters. Lara-Cabrera and Spooner (in press a) could not distinguish S. brachistotrichium from S. stenophyllidium morphologically. Spooner et al. (2004) could not distinguish the above elements with the additional accessions. Living plants of all three elements cultivated under similar conditions at Sturgeon Bay, WI, show a continuous variation."
wfo-0001025642,"Correll (1962) designated S. michoacanum as a nothospecies originating from a cross of S. bulbocastanum and S. pinnatisectum, as supported by the morphology of artificial hybrids raised by Graham and Dionne (1961). Solanum xmichoacanum occurs within the range of both of these species and is morphologically intermediate between them. It is similar to S. trifidum but differs in its taller stature and globose fruits. Our herbarium specimens collected in 1988 (Spooner et al. 1991a) suggested the nothospecies is sterile, because the fruits were devoid of seeds."
wfo-0001028698,"Solanum iopetalum is most similar to S. guerreroense and S. hougasii (Spooner et al. 1995). It has fewer interstitial leaflets (0-10) than S. guerreroense (8-19), and ellipsoid to conical fruits (globose in S. hougasii)."
wfo-0001032532,"Solanum woodsonii, like all four Mexican and Central American species in the Conicibaccata group, is distinguished by conical fruits, leaves with a somewhat parallel-sided morphology (mentioned in the descriptions as lateral leaflet pairs subequal or diminishing gradually towards the base) and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. It is most similar to S. agrimonifolium and S. oxycarpum. Solanum woodsonii is distinguished from S. agrimonifolium by it fewer numbers of lateral and interjected leaves (3-5 lateral, 0-2 interjected in S. woodsonii vs. 6-6 lateral, 4-31 interjected in S. agrimonifolium), and from S. oxycarpum by its larger leaves (25-40 cm long in S. woodsonii, 15-25 cm long in S. oxycarpum) (Spooner et al. 2001)."
wfo-0001028405,"Solanum hintonii could be confused with S. trifidum as both have white stellate corollas and conical fruits, but S. hintonii has lateral leaflets clearly petiolate and subequal in size, and S. trifidum has lateral leaflets subsessile and decurrent, with the proximal pair (when present) shorter than the distal pair."
wfo-0001030426,"Solanum pinnatisectum is one of the most distinctive wild potato species from North and Central America, easily distinguished by its 6-8 pairs of linear, lanceolate, to elliptic-lanceolate lateral leaflets. It would be hard to confuse with another species except for its putative hybrid with S. ehrenbergii, S. ×sambucinum (Hawkes 1990). Solanum ×sambucinum has lessfewer lateral leaflets (4-5) than S. pinnatisectum (6-8); S. ×sambucinum has lunate pseudostipules while S. pinnatisectum has pinnatifid pseudostipules; and S. ×sambucinum has lanceolate leaflets while S. pinnatisectum has linear-lanceolate leaflets. Correll (1962) designated S. ×michoacanum as a nothospecies originating from a cross of S. bulbocastanum and S. pinnatisectum and is somewhat morphologically intermediate between them but has many fewer lateral leaflets than S. pinnatisectum."
wfo-0001029055,"Solanum lesteri is easily distinguished in the field by its highly glandular leaves with a dense covering of Type A trichomes, its characteristic strong “mousy” odor, and on herbarium specimens with a yellowish or yellow-brown color to the foliage. It could be confused only with S. polyadenium but the two species are distinguished by fruit shape. Solanum lesteri has fruits triangular in face view (1.7-2.2 times as long as wide) and S. polyadenium has fruits globose or if triangular only up to 1.7 times as long as wide. "
wfo-0001030516,"Solanum polyadenium is easily distinguished in the field by its highly glandular leaves with a dense covering of Type A (short-stalked) trichomes, its characteristic strong “mousy” odor, and on herbarium specimens with a yellowish or yellow-brown color to the foliage. It could be confused with S. lesteri. Hawkes (1990) distinguished S. lesteri from S. polyadenium by its “dense indumentum of long spreading multicellular hairs on all green parts, in addition to the glandular ones,” and conical fruits, in contrast to S. polyadenium with the “the whole plant covered with very frequent stalked glands” and “very sparse multicellular non-glandular hairs,” and ovoid fruits. Examination of living representatives of these two species in Sturgeon Bay in 2001 by Spooner et al. (2004) showed great variation in S. lesteri; Hawkes et al. 1714 and Spooner et al. 4177 had the dense non-glandular hairs, but Spooner et al. 4155 had much less non-glandular pubescence more typical of S. polyadenium. In addition, some isotype specimens of S. polyadenium had a dense indumentum of non-glandular hairs. The only trait Spooner et al. (2004) could find to separate these species, therefore, was fruit shape. This fruit shape difference is not so evident, however, as the types of both S. polyadenium and its synonym S. polyadenium subsp. orizabae have short, triangular fruits, as do some other populations cited by Spooner et al. (2004). Not all herbarium specimens of either species have mature fruits. Solanum lesteri appears as an extreme, long triangular fruit variant of S. polyadenium. Their distribution pattern (S. lesteri at the southern end of the range of S. polyadenium) could argue for varietal or subspecies status for S. lesteri. Chloroplast DNA restriction site data (Spooner and Sytsma 1992) showed the two species to be united by 11 synapomorphies, but for the single population of S. lesteri to be distinguished from the three populations of S. polyadenium by three autapomorphies. Spooner et al. (2004) maintained them as separate because of the stark distinction of the fruit shapes in most specimens, but additional field and molecular studies may indicate that they intergrade more than is apparent here suggesting that one species is warranted."
wfo-0001025788,"Solanum agrimonifolium, like all four species in the Conicibaccata group, is distinguished by conical fruits, leaves with a somewhat parallel-sided morphology (mentioned in the descriptions as lateral leaflet pairs subequal or diminishing gradually towards the base) and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. As with most species from North and Central America, however, it is distinguished from its most similar species (S. longiconicum, S. oxycarpum, and S. woodsonii) only by a series of overlapping character states. Solanum agrimonifolium is distinguished from the above by its highly dissected leaves, with generally 6-7 lateral leaflets and 4-31 interjected leaflets), in contrast to the other species with generally 3-6 lateral leaflets and 0-6 interjected leaflets. The southernmost records of S. agrimonifolium were collected in Honduras, from Montaña La Tigre, all clustered within a few km of each other. Spooner et al. (2004) were not able to find the plants on our searches there in 2000 and the species may no longer grow in Honduras."
wfo-0001030147,"Solanum oxycarpum, like all four Mexican and Central American species in the Conicibaccata group, is distinguished by conical fruits, leaves with a somewhat parallel-sided morphology, and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. It is most similar to S. agrimonifolium and S. woodsonii (see discussion under S. woodsonii)."
wfo-0001031667,Solanum tarnii is similar to many other white-flowered diploid species from North and Central America but is distinguished by its relatively long calyx (10-13 mm long) with long acumens (2-6 mm long).
wfo-0001026695,Spooner et al. (2004) listed this hybrid here as an example of yet another possible hybrid combination. It grows with its parents and is morphologically intermediate between them.
wfo-0001027765,"Solanum ehrenbergii is very similar to S. stenophyllidium. It is distinguished by its ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate leaflets with the base cordate, oblique, or slightly truncate; in S. steonphyllidium the leaflets are linear to linear-lanceolate with an oblique base. Hawkes (1963) proposed S. ×sambucinum as a hybrid of S. cardiophyllum subsp. ehrenbergii (S. ehrenbergii) and S. pinnatisectum. Solanum ×sambucinum has more numerous lateral leaflets (4-5) than S. ehrenbergii (2-3, rarely 4). Bitter (1912) proposed a definitive description for Solanum cardiophyllum subsp. ehrenbergii based on a single specimen collected by Ehrenberg in Mexico and then housed at B; this holotype was destroyed. Spooner et al. (2004) agreed with Correll (1962) that S. ehrenbergii is an accepted species. "
wfo-0001025639,"Hawkes (1990) recognized two subspecies of S. ×edinense: subsp. edinense of putative hybrid origin between S. demissum and S. tuberosum subsp. tuberosum, and subsp. salamanii, a putative hybrid between S. demissum and S. tuberosum subsp. andigenum (Juz. and Bukasov) Hawkes. He distinguished the two subspecies by plant height and corolla color, but in practice he identified all populations collected in gardens in Europe as subsp. edinense and those collected in Mexico as subsp. salamanii. Spooner et al. (2004) observed a range of corolla colors and sizes in Mexico and cannot distinguish subspecies."
wfo-0001031097,"Solanum schenckii is partly distinguished by its decurrent leaflets, but this decurrence is sometimes only slight (see Fig. 46 in of Spooner et al., 2004), and other species occasionally produce decurrent leaflets as well (e.g., S. jamesii, Fig. 6 of Spooner et al., 2004). It also characteristically has calyx lobes wider than other species from North and Central America. Most specimens are much easier to identify in living condition, where they more clearly show the sharp contrast to the light violet coloration of the corolla abaxially, and very dark violet adaxially. Despite these minor and sometimes inconstant diagnostic characters, the species was well distinguished from other members of the group in the morphological phenetic study of Spooner et al. (1995). "
wfo-0001027483,"Solanum demissum is generally easily distinguished by its high pedicel articulation (in the distal ¼ of the pedicel) and inflorescences in the proximal ½ of the plant, but it can be confused with poorly pressed specimens of S. verrucosum (distinguished by its inrolled corolla margins) and S. stoloniferum (that like S. verrucosum has pedicel articulation below the distal ¼ of the pedicel). It frequently, but not consistently, has a semi-rosette habit seen elsewhere in the wild potatoes in North and Central America only in S. guerreroense. The collection Galeotti 1175 is a mixed gathering. Only one sheet of two at BR is S. demissum, which Spooner et al. (2004) chose as the lectotype of S. stoloniferum var. pumilum. Klotzsch (1849) based Solanum utile on plants he grew from seeds received in May of 1849 from Friedrich Otto, Director of the Berlin Botanic Garden. The seeds originally were distributed to the “Gessellschaft der Gartenfreunde Berlin’s” by the “Landes-Oekonomie-Collegium” for the purpose of cultivation and experimentation. The Klotzsch specimens at Berlin were destroyed; the neotype of Spooner et al. (2004) dates from 1852 and was part of Klotzsch's herbarium. Two other specimens at UPS from Klotzsch's herbarium are dated 1855. The neotype bears Bitter’s annotation “Solanum demissum var. klotzchii,” a name never published. Rybin (1929) indicated S. demissum f. xitlense had conical fruits, but the type specimen lacks mature fruits. The high-placed pedicel articulation and enlarged terminal leaflets clearly show it to be S. demissum. Solanum semidemissum Juz. ex Bukasov was first mentioned in Trudy Prikl. Bot. 47: 60, 480 (1930). Page 60 is the Russian text, and page 480 is its English translation, but there is no description. Juzepczuk (1937) validated the name and cited M. Antipovich 25 and M. Antopovich 28. WIR loaned Spooner et al. (2004) three sheets of Antipovich 25, and one flowering specimen of M. Antipovich 28, which these authors designated the latter as lectotype as it was the most complete specimen. Juzepczuk (1937) and Hawkes (1990) recognized S. semidemissum as a pentaploid nothospecies, formed by hybridization between S. demissum and S. verrucosum, distributed in the state of México and the Federal District. Pentaploid populations (2n = 5x = 60) similar to these species have been identified as S. semidemissum (Rybin 1933; Juzepczuk 1937; Hawkes 1944), supporting a hybrid origin, but Spooner et al. (2004) could not find any characters to give them even a hint of traits with which to distinguish these hybrids. Solanum semidemissum possibly is a hybrid taxon, which bears further investigation with field study. Spooner et al. (2004) provided the herbarium annotations Hawkes made for S. semidemissum to aid others to pursue this further, but cite them in their treatment as S. demissum: Antipovich 25; Balls et al. 5046; Flores S-696; Hawkes et al. 1597; Hawkes et al. 1675, 2501, 2502, 2503; Lyonnet 2147; Martínez s.n.; Tarn 78; Tarn & Flores 72, 79; Ugent et al. 1188. Hawkes (1944) listed syntypes for the following three names for which Spooner et al. (2004) designated lectotypes. For S. demissum var. mastoidostigma he cited Balls et al. 4242, Balls et al. 4246 (the lectotype) and Balls et al. 5009; material of Balls et al. 4242 was not located. He based S. demissum var. orientale on Balls et al. 4441 (the lectotype), Balls et al. (4621a, and Balls et al. 5305. For S. demissum var. demissum f. tolucense he listed Balls et al. 4971 and Balls et al. 4971/2 (the lectotype), both from the same locality but the second collection at 11,000 ft. and dated three days later. Solanum ×edinense is of clear hybrid origin between S. demissum and the cultivated species S. tuberosum. It can be distinguished from S. demissum by its generally wider leaves and taller stature, and from S. tuberosum by its high-placedpedicel articulation. It differs from both its parents by its pentaploidy."
wfo-0001028465,"Solanum hougasii is especially similar to S. guerreroense and S. iopetalum (Spooner et al.1995), but differs in the shape of the fruit; Solanum hougasii has globose fruits, and S. iopetalum has ovoid to conical fruits."
wfo-0001026858,"Solanum cardiophyllum is very similar to S. ehrenbergii, S. jamesii, and S. stenophyllidium. It is distinguished from all of the above by its white-cream to light yellow colored corollas (vs. pure white or pure white tinged with violet), its minute calyx lobe acumens only to 0.5 mm long (vs. 1-2.5 mm long), and its small anthers 3-4 mm long (vs. 4.5-6 mm long)."
wfo-0001026696,"Solanum bulbocastanum is one of the most distinctive wild potato species from North and Central America, easily distinguished by its simple leaves and cream to light yellow corollas. It would be hard to confuse with another species except possibly the simple-leaved species with white corollas S. clarum and S. morelliforme that are much smaller plants (stems 2-3 mm wide at base, generally under 0.5 m tall; vs. S. bulbocastanum with stems 3-6 mm wide at base, plants up to 1 m tall). Correll (1962) designated S. ×michoacanum as a valid nothospecies originating from a cross of S. bulbocastanum and S. pinnatisectum. It is somewhat morphologically intermediate between them but has lateral leaflets and S. bulbocastanum has none. "
wfo-0001030167,"Solanum pacificum is a climbing species recognizable by its completely glabrous vegetative parts; slender, weakly herbaceous stems; small, greenish flowers; and large, very thin leaves. The leaves of S. pacificum are deep purplish-green above with whitish veins, and are weakly to intensely purple below. The upper surfaces of fresh leaves have a distinctly velvety luster. Within sect. Herpystichum, this species is most similar to S. dolichorhachis, but differs in having leaves with &plusmn; symmetrical vs. distinctly oblique leaf bases and green, herbaceous vs. tan, woody stems. It can be distinguished from other climbing species by the texture, shape, and size of the leaves. Solanum pacificum is also similar to the sympatric S. leptorhachis Bitter [sect. Geminata (G. Don) Walp.] in the size and shape of the leaves, the long, slender inflorescences, and small, greenish-white, stellate flowers; however, S. leptorhachis is an upright, woody shrub with unifoliate sympodial units on flowering stems and geminate leaves at non-flowering nodes. In contract, S. pacificum has plurifoliate sympodial units and always has only one leaf per node (i.e., not geminate).
"
wfo-0001029088,"Solanum limoncochaense is one of the ground-trailing species and can easily be recognized by its simple, palmately veined leaves, glabrous vegetative parts, and stellate flowers. It is most similar to the Colombian S. dalibardiforme, which is pubescent throughout, has rotate-stellate corollas, and appears to be a strictly high-elevation species. This species grows in dense patches on the rainforest floor and over fallen trees. It is a weak climber, and plants in the field were encountered climbing tree trunks up to ca. 1 m from the ground (E. J. Tepe and S. Stern, pers. obs.).
"
wfo-0001027378,"Solanum dalibardiforme is one of the ground-trailing species, and is one of the most distinctive species of the section. It can be distinguished from the rest of the species in this group by its simple leaves and rotate-stellate to pentagonal corollas. It is most similar to the Ecuadorean S. limoncochaense, but has pubescent vegetative parts, pentagonal corollas, and occurs in high elevation habitats. Solanum trifolium is the only other member of sect. Herpystichum with considerable interpetalar tissue, resulting in pentagonal or rotate corollas, but is easily distinguished by its 3-foliate compound leaves. We have seen only one scan of a fruiting specimen of this species (L. Reyes 119, COL), and the fruits appear to be elliptical and pointed apically, but without the distinctive arrowhead shape of S. limoncochaense, S. phaseoloides, S. pentaphyllum, and S. trifolium. It is not possible to determine the cross sectional shape of the fruit from the pressed specimens available, and it is not clear whether this species has flattened fruits like the rest of the ground-trailing species.

wfo-0001030311,"Solanum pentaphyllum is one of the ground-trailing species, and can easily be differentiated from the others based on its 5-foliate leaves. The leaves from several populations in Antioquia, Colombia are smaller than the average and are reddish below. The two collections known from Costa Rica are indistinguishable from South American collections. We obtained trnT-trnF and trnS-trnG sequences from one of the Costa Rican collections (Haber & Zuchowski 9863, NY), and it was well supported as sister to the South American collection of S. pentaphyllum rather than with Costa Rican S. phaseoloides (Fig. 4 in Tepe & Bohs 2011). Based on available collections, S. pentaphyllum is apparently absent from Panama, thus the Costa Rican collections represent a significant disjunction from the species' primary range in Colombia and Venezuela. The labels of two collections state that the deep green to purplish-brown fruits dig themselves into the ground during development (Pittier 8031, GH; Tamayo 2224, G). From these labels, it is unclear whether the fruits are actively pressed in to the ground by the plant and are truly geocarpic - this seems unlikely because the infructescences of this species are very thin - or if they become buried during development as they lie on the ground. This intriguing phenomenon merits further research.
The protologue of S. pentaphyllum var. caraboboanum states that this variety differs from variety pentaphyllum in that it is smaller and less pubescent than var. pentaphyllum, and has a distribution in northern Venezuela. These morphological characters hold true for some specimens, but the same variation can be found among specimens throughout the range of the species. We were unable to identify any consistent morphological character to reliably identify variety caraboboanum, and could not separate the varieties unless their provenance was known. As a result, S. pentaphyllum var. caraboboanum is not recognized in this treatment.
"
wfo-0001030342,"Solanum phaseoloides is a ground-trailing species characterized by 3-foliate leaves and stellate flowers. It is most similar to S. pentaphyllum from which it differs by its 3-foliate vs. 5-foliate leaves. It also resembles S. trifolium, but can be differentiated by its white, stellate flowers and pointed leaf apices vs. blue-violet, rotate flowers and rounded leaf apices. Vegetative parts of most collections are glabrous; however, plants with pubescent stems and petioles appear to be localized in the Cordillera de Talamanca in Costa Rica at 1,700-3,200 m. A single collection of S. phaseoloides is known from north-central Peru. The leaves of this collection are somewhat fleshier than typical plants from Central America, but it corresponds to them in other characters. If this specimen truly represents a population of S. phaseoloides, then it is a remarkable disjunction from the species' native range in Central America. Alternatively, it is possible that this collection represents an additional species of sect. Herpystichum; however, we must reserve judgment until additional collections are available. We have been unable to successfully obtain a DNA sequence from this Peruvian collection. Finally, we have not seen collections of S. phaseoloides from Nicaragua; however, its presence there is expected based on the overall distribution of this species."
wfo-0001031864,"Solanum trifolium, a ground-trailing species, is the only species in sect. Herpystichum with compound leaves and rotate flowers. The other two species with compound leaves, S. pentaphyllum and S. phaseoloides, both have stellate flowers, and the only other species with rotate or rotate-stellate flowers is S. dalibardiforme, which has simple leaves."
wfo-0001027184,"Solanum complectans is a member of Solanum section Anarrhichomonum Bitter, a small and distinctive group of herbaceous scramblers distributed from Mexico to Peru. The affinities of this section are with the potatoes, tomatoes and relatives (Bohs, 2005). It is significant that neither this species nor any other in sect. Anarrhichomenum has been found in Bolivia previously, especially not in the central and northern parts of the Department of La Paz whose cloud forests have been the most explored part of the entire country. This indicates a strong disjuction of this species from its relatives in northern Peru to Mexico (Correll 1962; Anderson & Jansen, 1998). The only specimen of Solanum complectans with simple or 3-foliolate leaves is from the furthest northwest (Salinas 2243); in other respects it resembles the rest of the material available. In Correll (1962) S. complectans would key best to S. chimborazense Bitter, known only from Ecuador, but that species bears green fruits ca. 2 cm in diameter, has leaves with only three, or less commonly five, leaflets, and the filaments are united into a crown. The specific epithet refers to the habit of embracing or holding fast (Latin complector) to the supporting tree by means of its adventitious roots."
wfo-0001027770,"Solanum elaeagnifolium is native to the New World, and it has been introduced worldwide and is common in drier areas; it is a serious pest of pastures where it has been introduced (Boyd et al. 1984; e.g., Australia). It spreads by underground stolons and can regenerate from very small pieces of rootstock (Invasive Species South Africa 2012). In South Africa roots can be as deep as 12 feet in sandy soil (Hattingh s.n.) and only repeated ploughing to a depth of 2 feet will clear the soil (Potgeiter s.n.). In both its native and adventive distribution S. elaeagnifolium is polymorphic for possession of prickles and in Africa both forms occur, even in a single area (e.g., Hattingh s.n., K). In Africa, S. elaeagnifolium is not easily confused with any other species of Solanum with its stoloniferous habit, narrow leaves and silvery pubescence. The bright orange prickles on prickly morphs might suggest the Madagascan endemic S. pyracanthos, but that species has large purple (rather than small, white or purplish white) flowers and larger leaves. In South Africa, the filiform prickles and prominent leaf venation of some young S. burchellii plants can be reminiscent of S. elaeagnifolium but the prickles of S. burchellii are yellow, its leaves are wider, and its flowers are smaller. Other narrow leaved African solanums such as S. glabratum and S. sodomaeodes could be confused with S. elaeagnifolium in the herbarium, but neither of these two species is currently sympatric with S. elaeagnifolium. Both S. glabratum and S. sodomaeodes have strongly curved prickles and abaxial leaf trichomes with fewer rays. Solanum lanzae of the black cotton soils of East Africa is also currently not sympatric with S. elaeagnifolium, but has similar narrow leaves and often lacks prickles. Solanum lanzae has larger flowers (9-15 mm in diameter versus 25-40 mm) than does S. eleagnifolium, and has stem trichomes with fewer rays."
wfo-0001025638,"Solanum ×brucheri is a natural triploid hybrid between S. acaule (2n=48) and S. infundibuliforme (2n=24) (Okada and Clausen, 1985). Synthetic hybridizations between these species were carried out by Okada and Clausen (1985) and compared to the natural populations, confirming the parentage of this species. Solanum ×viirsooi can be differentiated from S. acaule by the its larger anthers and articulated pedicels, in contrast to the very similar S. acaule with smaller anthers and non-articulated pedicels. From S. megistacrolobum it can be differentiated by the number of lateral leaflets and by the rotate corollas. From S. ×aemulans it can be differentiated by the narrow elliptic to elliptic-linear lateral leaflets and by the acute to obtuse apex of the terminal leaflet. From S. infundibuliforme it can be differentiated by its rosette habit, its generally broader and more numerous lateral leaflets, and the inflorescences situated near the base."
wfo-0001026203,"Solanum andreanum is morphologically diverse, with some of the tetraploid cytotypes sometimes being more robust. Based on field work in Colombia and Ecuador and comparative morphological data from herbarium specimens, Spooner et al. (1993) synonymized under S. andreanum the diploid species S. baezense, S. cyanophyllum, S. pichinchense, S. serratoris, and S. suffrutescens. Subsequently, we also discovered S. baezense, S. correllii, and S. regularifolium to also be synonyms. Based on unpublished molecular data from single-copy DNA sequences and morphological data from Ames and Spooner (2008), we also synonymize under S. andreanum the names S. paucijugum, S. solisii, and S. tuquerrense that refer to tetraploid populations. These are morphologically indistinguishable from S. andreanum and related to it, although S. paucijugum and S. tuquerrense are supported as of allopolyploid origin with other species farther to the south in Peru. Their common occurrence in southern Colombia and Ecuador, their morphological similarity, and common relationships (despite allopolyploid origins of the tetraploids) lead us to subsume all these names into one. Our concept of S. andreanum includes diploids and allopolyploids of S. andreanum and very closely related members of clade 3 (the Piurana clade) that are impossible to distinguish morphologically from S. andreanum. To distinguish S. andreanum from the other related wild potatoes within clade 3 (Piurana clade) it is necessary to consider two factors, geographical distribution and morphological habit. Solanum andreanum is restricted to southern Colombia and Ecuador and overlaps with S. olmosense, S. chilliasense, S. minutifoliolum, S. albornozii, and S. chomatophilum. Solanum olmosense has leaves widely decurrent onto the rachis and S. andreanum has leaves without a decurrent rachis. Solanum chilliasense has terminal leaflets considerably larger than the lateral leaflets and S. andreanum has terminal leaflets equal to or slightly larger than the lateral leaflets. Solanum minutifoliolum has densely hairy leaves and S. andreanum has glabrous to subglabrous leaves. Solanum albornozii has narrow leaflets and more revolute margins and S. andreanum has wider leaflets and straight margins. The morphological distinction between some populations of S. chomatophilum and S. andreanum is difficult but S. andreanum is often a larger plant and has slightly pubescent to subglabrous leaves whereas S. chomatophilum is a smaller plant and can have completely glabrous leaves."
wfo-0001025669,"Correll (1962), Hawkes (1990), and Ochoa (1999) placed S. acaule (tetraploid) in series Acaulia Juz., and related it to S. albicans (Ochoa) Ochoa, a hexaploid species from Ecuador and northern Peru. Many studies have made it clear, however, that both S. acaule and S. albicans are also closely related to S. demissum Lindl., a species from Mexico and Guatemala that Correll (1962) and Hawkes (1990), placed in the separate series Demissa Bukasov. The relationships of S. acaule, S. albicans, and S. demissum were shown by Bonierbale et al. (1990) and Debener et al. (1990) with single- to low-copy nuclear restriction fragment polymorphisms, by Spooner et al. (1995) and Kardolus (1999) with morphological data, by Kardolus (1998) and Jacobs et al. (2008) with Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data, and by Nakagawa and Hosaka (2002) with plastid and nuclear RFLPs. Based on these data Spooner et al. (2004) extracted S. demissum from its other North and Central American hexaploid relatives in series Demissa Bukasov, and classified S. acaule, S. albicans, and S. demissum in an informal Acaulia Group. The taxonomy of S. acaule and S. albicans has been a state of flux, with changing ideas on the status of S. albicans, and with varying treatments of infraspecific categories within S. acaule at the subspecies, varietal, and form ranks. We do not partition S. acaule into infraspecific categories as do Correll (1962), Hawkes (1990), and Ochoa (1999). Hosaka and Spooner (1992) used 94 probe-enzyme combinations of nuclear RFLPs to examine 105 accessions of all three subspecies (sensu Hawkes, 1990) of S. acaule (subsp. acaule, aemulans, punae) and of S. albicans throughout their distribution area, from northern Peru to northern Argentina. They were able to support the recognition of S. albicans and all subspecies of S. acaule except subsp. acaule and subsp. punae that were combined into one. In the present treatment we recognize S. acaule, S. albicans, and S. ×aemulans at the species level with no infraspecific categories, and treat subsp. punae as a synonym of S. acaule. Kardolus (1999) used phenetic analysis of morphological data to distinguish most accessions of subsp. acaule and subsp. punae, and he ascribed the mixture of the two in the study of Hosaka and Spooner (1992) to be due to misidentifications. McGregor et al. (2002) likewise supported both subsp. acaule and subsp. punae with AFLP data, but the molecular distinction between the two was slight, and again, reidentifications were needed to make their AFLP and morphological data fit each other. Taxonomists have distinguished these two taxa by overlapping character states of habit and pubescence, with subsp. punae very rosette-like and with long-spreading hairs on the stem, petiole, and leaf, and subsp. acaule with less flat rosettes and shorter appressed hairs. We find these characters to be so variable as to be impossible to use. More difficult to treat is S. acaule subsp. palmirense. Kardolus (1998) described this as the first known hexaploid cytotype of S. acaule, based on a single collection from Chimborazo Province, Ecuador (Spooner et al. 5070). At that time, this was the only known Ecuadorian collection of either S. acaule or S. albicans, but our treatment found another collection of S. albicans from the same province (Ochoa 13395). Kardolus (1998) classified subsp. palmirense in S. acaule, rather than in S. albicans, based on AFLP affinities of the former, despite the fact that its ploidy and morphology was a near match for S. albicans. A subsequent AFLP study by McGregor et al. (2002) also grouped subsp. palmirense with S. acaule. Solanum albicans is considered to be a hybrid of S. acaule and another species (Hawkes, 1990), and its AFLP distinction from other populations of S. albicans may be due to another hybrid origin. While Kardolus’s (1998) placement of subsp. palmirense into S. acaule may be correct, we consider this issue unsolved from lack of sufficient comparative material. We synonymize this subspecies into S. albicans because of its morphological and ploidy affinities with that species. Solanum acaule is in the pedigree of the hybrid cultivated potato species S. juzepczukii Bukasov (a triploid hybrid of diploid clones of S. tuberosum L. and S. acaule) and S. curtilobum Juz. and Bukasov (a pentaploid hybrid of tetraploid clones of S. tuberosum and S. juzepczukii) (Hawkes, 1962; Schmiediche et al., 1980, 1982). It is also a parent in the hybrid wild species S. ×indunii K. A. Okada and A. M. Clausen (S. acaule × S. boliviense Dunal) (Okada and Clausen, 1982), and S. ×viirsooi K. A. Okada and A. M. Clausen (S. acaule × S. infundibuliforme Phil.) (Okada and Clausen, 1985). Kardolus and Groendijk-Wilders (1998) studied the inflorescence architecture of members of series Acaulia, series Demissa, and series Megistacroloba. They described five types of inflorescence architecture, including a type not recognized previously of a monochasium with an ""extra"" flower at its base in series Acaulia and S. demissum. None of these were species-specific and even varied on individual plants, but showed species-specific tendencies towards one type."
wfo-0001026607,"Cárdenas and Hawkes (1946) recognized two taxa from different collections of Cárdenas 3505 mounted on different sheets: Solanum toralapanum variety subintegrifolium and S. ellipsifolium. Hawkes and Hjerting (1985a) attempted to describe Solanum astleyi but failed to designate a holotype. They later corrected this in Hawkes and Hjerting (1985b) when they designated a holotype and referred to their original publication. Solanum boliviense, S. megistacrolobum, S. sanctae-rosae, and S. toralapanum (the latter variously recognized at the species, subspecies, and varietal ranks) are very similar morphologically and until this taxonomic treatment have been recognized as distinct taxa (Correll, 1962; Hawkes and Hjerting, 1969, 1989; Ochoa, 1984, 1990; Giannattasio and Spooner 1994a, b; Spooner et al., 1997). Regarding S. megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum, Giannattasio and Spooner (1994a) examined their species status with morphological data and Giannattasio and Spooner (1994b) with single- to low-copy nuclear DNA restriction site data. They found the two taxa to be very similar with both data sets, but distinguished only by multivariate analysis of the data (no taxon-specific characters were found). They recognized the two taxa as subspecies of S. megistacrolobum. Regarding S. astleyi and S. boliviense, Spooner et al. (1997) used Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) data to examine these morphologically very similar species. They found that they could be distinguished with RAPDs, but only by genetic distances supporting subspecies. They recognized S. astleyi as a subspecies of S. boliviense. Regarding S. sanctae-rosae, we considered this a good species until Amplified Fragment Length (AFLP) DNA data (Jacobs et al., 2008) and our unpublished DNA sequence data showed it to be in a group with S. megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum. The above results forced us to reconsider the species status of all of these taxa with the morphological data from herbarium specimens needed for this comprehensive taxonomic treatment of Solanum. Regarding herbarium specimen data from the literature, we compared the independent identifications of S. boliviense, S. megistacrolobum, and S. toralapanum from taxonomic treatments of sect. Petota from Bolivia by Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) and Ochoa (1990). Of the 69 collection numbers cited in common for these three species (excluding type specimens) 12 of them (17.4%) were provided with different identifications between treatments. This analysis suggests that these taxa are too narrowly defined to be distinguished by practical morphological means. Regarding our own inspection of herbarium sheets, our attempts to identify herbarium specimens showed so much overlap of putative “species-specific” traits, sometimes within single populations, that we decided to synonymize all of these names. We consider the single-copy nuclear RFLP and AFLP data to highlight microevolutionary divergence that is best regarded as biological races (Mallett, 2008), but not populations that have yet diverged to biological species. Solanum boliviense is very similar to S. acaule and S. ×aemulans. Solanum boliviense and S. ×aemulans have articulated pedicels but S. acaule lacks articulated pedicels. Solanum boliviense can be differentiated from Solanum ×aemulans by the number of lateral leaflets and by the pentagonal corolla."
wfo-0001025636,"Solanum ×aemulans is distributed in two disjunct areas of Argentina in 1) Jujuy and Salta Provinces, 2) La Rioja Province. Triploid and tetraploid cytotypes are found in the northern range of its distribution (Jujuy and Salta), while only tetraploids occur in the Province of La Rioja. This species is frequently found growing with the following tuber-bearing species: S. acaule, S. oplocense, S. infundibuliforme, S. boliviense and S. brevicaule. Solanum ×aemulans can be differentiated from S. acaule by the presence of the articulated pedicel, by its larger stamens, and frequently by the strong scent of the leaves. From S. megistacrolobum it can be differentiated by the number of lateral leaflets and by the rotate to rotate pentagonal corollas. From S. ×viirsooi  it can be differentiated by the broadly ovate to lateral leaflets and by the rounded apex of the terminal leaflet. A natural triploid hybrid of S. acaule × S. boliviense (referred to as S. megistacrolobum) was described by Okada and Clausen (1982) as S. ×indunii, as this nothospecies possesses characters of both parental species and co-occurs with them. These populations are common in northwest Argentina and were differentiated from S. acaule ssp. aemulans on the basis of minor morphological characters. Furthermore, these authors pointed out that the populations from Tilcara (Jujuy Province) of S. acaule ssp. aemulans and the hybrids of S. acaule x S. megistacrolobum had characters in common which could be interpreted as having a similar origin through the functioning of 2n gametes that could have resulted in a fertile hybrid tetraploid. Hosaka and Spooner (1992) were able to differentiate the two disjunct populations of aemulans on the basis of single-to low-copy nuclear DNA, but Nakagawa et al. (2002) could distinguish these on the basis of plastid DNA restriction site data. We group the triploids (S. ×indunii) and tetraploids (S. ×aemulans ) together because of likely common origins and because they are morphologically indistinguishable, and we group the two sets of tetraploids together because they are morphologically indistinguishable. However, S. boliviense does not occur in the southern distribution range in La Rioja Province and as mentioned above they can be distinguished with plastid and nuclear DNA markers. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) consider S. acaule not very closely related to any other wild potato species, although they point out similarities with species of the series Megistacroloba. They agree with Okada and Clausen (1982) in their interpretation of the hybrid origin of aemulans from Tilcara but consider that this interpretation is not valid for the type material from La Rioja, since S. megistacrolobum has not been found there."
wfo-0001025869,"Solanum amayanum is most similar morphologically to highly pubescent morphotypes of the widespread and variable S. candolleanum from which it differs by its enlarged ovate to obovate terminal leaflets.
"
wfo-0001029785,"Solanum neorossii was described on the basis of Hawkes et al. 3878 from Rodeopampa, Argentina but no other specimens were cited. The authors stated that probably this species was much more widespread, extending into the province of Jujuy, Argentina, as well as into Bolivia. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) included S. neorosii in their treatment of the Bolivian potatoes, as they indicate that it occurs so near the Bolivian border that it may occur there, but we have not found any Bolivian collections. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) stated that S. neorossii increases in size under cultivation to a much greater extent than other species studied, and produces leaves with four lateral leaflets, a character usually not observed in the wild. Hoffman 1874, collected near the type locality and annotated by Hawkes as S. neorossii on a herbarium sheet at PTIS, has pale violet flowers (almost white flowers with darker violet below) and not the dark blue color stated in the description of S. neorossii. K.A. Okada collected a number of accessions from the Province of Jujuy and in eastern Salta Province, and initially considered these to be a new species that he referred to as “S. hannemanii”. This name subsequently appeared on these collections in genebank catalogues and in some publications, but was never validly published. Many of these specimens have purple nerves and in some cases purple pubescence, but are similar in habit, leaf and flower morphology to S. neorossii (including the white flowers with darker violet below). Van den Berg and Groendijk-Wilders (2007) provided morphological and AFLP data to support the recognition of S. hannemanii as a new species, but did not include comparative analysis with accessions of S. neorossii, nor did they publish the name in accordance with the Botanical Code, making S. hannemanii a nomen nudum. On the basis of the original description and illustration of S. neorossii and the herbarium material studied we consider S. hannemanii to be a synonym of S. neorossii. Solanum neorossii has been found growing in the vicinity of S. venturii, S. vernei and S. acaule. A number of specimens present intermediate characters between S. neorosii and S. venturii: corolla pale mauve, leaves with up to 2 or 3 pair of lateral leaflets, and slightly acuminate leaflets. We list these specimens in our database as hybrids between S. venturii and S. neorossii. Solanum neorosii can be differentiated from S. venturii by the decumbent habit, blue color of the corolla and by the terminal leaflet generally broadly ovate to elliptical with the apex usually obtuse to rounded. From S. vernei it can be differentiated by its larger terminal leaflet in the lowermost leaves and by the absence of the dense pubescence characteristic of S. vernei. It is not morphologically similar to S. acaule."
wfo-0001027035,"Solanum chomatophilum (with lilac to blue corollas) is morphologically similar to S. albornozii and S. augustii, but the latter two species have white corollas. Solanum chomatophilum is a morphologically very variable species, making it difficult to distinguish from these two taxa by other characters. Ochoa deposited many of his types in “herb. OCH” or “herb. Ochoa,” his personal herbarium. He recently distributed many of these types to various herbaria but there is no published record of these distributions. We located most of them at CUZ and most of them are labeled as holotype. Ochoa (1954) did not designate a herbarium for the deposition of the type of S. jalcae Ochoa, and we located seven duplicates. We consider the holotype to be a specimen at CUZ labeled as holotype and matching the illustration in the description. "
wfo-0001029334,"Solanum malmeanum is sympatric with S. commersonii and S. chacoense. It can be differentiated from S. commersonii by its generally subequal uppermost lateral leaflets that do not decrease rapidly in size towards the base, by its generally petiolulate and larger lateral leaflets, and by its white flowers. The flowers are almost always white, although in a very few cases we have observed a small bluish spot very different from the characteristic dark stripes along the rays abaxially in flowers of S. commersonii. These populations could represent probable hybrids between S. malmeanum and S. commersonii. From S. chacoense it can be differentiated by its smaller and sometimes rosette-forming habit, by the obtuse to more rarely acute apex of the terminal leaflet, and generally by a shorter peduncle. Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) and Hawkes (1990) considered S. malmeanum and S. commersonii as subspecies of S. commersonii and distinguished subsp. malmeanum from subsp. commersonii by the bases of leaflets decreasing gradually towards the base of the leaf, narrowly decurrent to petiolulate leaflets, low to median pedicel articulation, and corolla always white. Correll (1962) treated subspecies malmeanum as a form of S. commersonii and distinguished it from S. commersonii by the presence of at least some petiolulate leaflets and often two or more interjected leaflets. Mentz and Oliveira (2004) stated that some populations of S. malmeanum, when grown in glasshouses, did not maintain the white color of their flowers and consider these populations as possible hybrids. We have not seen this behavior in the populations we grew. Mentz and Oliveira (2004) considered S. malmeanum as a form of S. commersonii, but questioned the validity of even this rank on the basis of the differences stated."
wfo-0001027157,"Solanum commersonii overlaps in distribution with morphologically similar S. malmeanum and S. chacoense. From S. malmeanum it can be differentiated by the uppermost lateral leaflets decreasing rapidly toward the base, shorter lateral leaflets and the violet (not white) corolla color. From S. chacoense it can be differentiated by its smaller plant habit, the lateral leaflets decreasing rapidly toward the leaf base, the larger terminal leaflet, the lower number of lateral leaflets and violet (not white) flower color. Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) and Hawkes (1990) considered S. malmeanum and S. commersonii as subspecies of commersonii and distinguished subsp. malmeanum from subsp. commersonii on the bases of leaflets decreasing gradually toward the base, narrowly decurrent to petiolulate leaflets, low to median articulation, and corolla always white. Correll (1962) treated these taxa as forms and considered f. malmeanum to be distinguished from commersonii by the presence of at least some petiolulate leaflets and often two or more interjected leaflets. Metz and Oliveira (2004) stated that some populations of S. malmeanum when grown in glasshouses did not maintain the white color of their flowers and consider these populations as possible hybrids. We have not seen this behavior in the populations we grew. Metz and Oliveira (2004) considered S. malmeanum as a form of S. commersonii, but questioned the validity of even this rank on the basis of the differences stated. Fourteen triploid counts have been reported from various publications from Uruguay and Brazil (Hijmans et al., 2007), but vouchers have not been made or are unclear."
wfo-0001028888,"Solanum kurtzianum can be distinguished from the very similar S. chacoense by its finely ciliate leaflets and its generally smaller size (0.15 - 0.5 m tall vs. 0.5-2 m tall in S. chacoense). A natural hybrid between S. kurtzianum and S. chacoense was described by Brücher (1962) as S. ruiz-lealii, and this was accepted by Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) and Hawkes (1990). Brücher (1966) later argued against this hybrid origin as one of the putative parents has never been reported from the province of Mendoza. Raimondi et al. (2005) examined the hypothesis of hybridization by phenetic analyses of morphological and molecular data and cytological analyses of interspecific hybrids. They concluded that S. ruiz-lealii is not a recent natural hybrid of S. kurtzianum x S. chacoense but originated by divergence of S. chacoense or by hybridization between S. chacoense and another unnamed taxon and proposed to maintain the species status of S. ruiz-lealii. Brücher (1962) differentiated S. ruiz-lealii from S. chacoense by its very short and glabrous calyx lobes, corollas with prominent stellate shape, and triangular winged stem. Raimondi et al. (2005) confirmed the morphological differences between S. ruiz-lealii and S. chacoense, but not between S. ruiz-lealii and S. kurtzianum. On the basis of their molecular study, S. ruiz-lealii appears as a separate entity but more related to S. chacoense than to S. kurtzianum. On the basis of our analysis of herbarium data, many populations of S. kurtzianum have white flowers, are subglabrous, and have fruits that are green or green with white dots. The characters of S. ruiz-lealii fall within the range of variation of S. kurtzianum and we consider them to be conspecific. We observed specimens collected at the type locality of S. ruiz-lealii in Mendoza, from Punta de Agua, and from Aguanda (in the same province). These specimens have the leaf characters of S. kurtzianum, including the ciliate margins. It is frequently difficult to distinguish S. chacoense from S. kurtzianum, but based upon the comparisons of germplasm specimens in a common garden and of herbarium specimens, and due to the fact that S. chacoense does not occur in Mendoza Province, we consider that the specimens both from Punta de Agua and Aguanda are S. kurtzianum."
wfo-0001030271,"Solanum paucissectum is similar to S. chilliasense of Ecuador. Both species have glabrous and coriaceous leaves and a terminal leaflet considerably larger than the lateral leaflets. However, they differ because S. chilliasense has leaflets acuminate at the tips and undulate margins whereas S. paucissectum has acute leaflet tips and entire leaflet margins."

Solanum piurae and S. chomatophilum both have blue corollas as does S. acroglossum, but S. acroglossum differs from S. piurae in its sessile leaflets; S. piurae has petiolulate leaflets. Solanum chomatophilum differs from S. acroglossum in the number of interjected leaflets; Solanum chomatophilum usually has around 20, whereas S. acroglossum generally has 0 to 14."
wfo-0001031484,"Solanum stipuloideum is one of the most distinctive species in sect. Petota. Unlike many species in South America, it possesses white, stellate corollas. Its elliptic-conical fruits are somewhat similar to those of members of the Conicibaccata Group (e.g. S. colombianum Bitter), or to S. trifidum Correll from Mexico, but the fruits are narrower and distinctly pointed at the end. Solanum stipuloideum has been treated in various ways (reviewed in Van den Berg & N. Groendijk-Wilders, 1999). The most recent treatments by Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) and Hawkes (1990) recognized three species and two varieties (S. circaeifolium subsp. circaeifolium and subsp. quimense, S. capsicibaccatum, and S. soestii), and Ochoa (1990) recognized two species and two varieties (S. circaeifolium var. circaeifolium and var. capsicibaccatum, and S. soestii). These authors emphasized leaf and calyx pubescence, terminal leaflet size and shape, peduncle and pedicel length, and corolla diameter as key characters to distinguish these taxa (Van den Berg & N. Groendijk-Wilders, 1999). Specimens of S. circaeifolium subsp. circaeifolium were identified as narrowly restricted to the extreme northern portion of the range near Lake Titicaca in Dept. La Paz, S. soestii to a single locality in southern La Paz Dept., and the other taxa more widespread and overlapping in range (Hawkes and Hjerting, 1989; Ochoa, 1990). Van den Berg and Groendijk-Wilders (1999) evaluated the validity of these taxa with morphological data and Van den Berg et al. (2001) with RAPD and AFLP data. The morphological data documented extensive overlap of all 26 characters they analyzed but 18 of them showed statistically significant differences among taxa (0.05 level). The RAPD data distinguished S. soestii but not the other taxa and the AFLP data distinguished all of the taxa recognized by Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) and Hawkes (1990). However, a subsequent AFLP study by Jacobs et al. (2008), using a much wider range of species, supported all of these species as a distinct group, but failed to separate them into species-specific groups. Our examination of 96 herbarium specimens from throughout the range of these names show so much overlap of taxon-specific characters that identifications become impossible with morphological data. Only by reference to locality data could we identify S. circaeifolium subsp. circaeifolium and S. soestii, but not the other names that have no defined range. For example, Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) partly key out S. capsicibaccatum based on its non-acuminate leaflet apices. Yet this character is not clearly distinct, and both acute and acuminate leaflet apices occur on the types of all taxa recognized by the above authors, as well as specimens throughout the range of these names. We examined variation in leaf dissection that ranged from simple leaves (supposedly species-specific for S. circaeifolium subsp. circaeifolium and confined to the northern part of the range of all of these names) to 1-4-jugate leaves farther south. In the north, the specimens were mostly simple (rarely 1-jugate) but many populations to the south also had simple leaves (e.g., Brooke 3051, 3037, Solomon 17510). Solanum soestii is distinguished by lanceolate to linear-lanceolate leaflets with the terminal and lateral leaflets about the same size. We found no exact match for the type but there are many specimens similar with linear-lanceolate leaflets (e.g., Cárdenas 5519, Hjerting et al. 4486) and specimens with wider leaflets but of subequal size (e.g., Hawkes et al. 6578), and consider S. soestii to fall within the range of S. capsicibaccatum. In addition, a collection by Spooner et al. (1994) in Bolivia in 1993 at the sole known locality of S. soestii, Spooner et. al. 6722 (BOLV, PTIS, WAG, WIS), while a close match to the type, shows certain characters differing from the type. Most notably, some leaves have lateral leaflets decreasing in size towards the base, diverging from the subequal sizes described for the type.

wfo-0001030444,Solanum piurae is morphologically similar to S. acroglossum and to some populations of S. chomatophilum. These species are similar because their stems have leaves glabrous adaxially and lilac to blue corollas. Solanum piurae has petiolulate lateral leaflets whereas S. acroglossum has sessile lateral leaflets; S. chomatophilum has lateral leaflets varying from sessile to petiolulate.
wfo-0001027223,"According to Ochoa (1999) S. contumazaense has some similarities with S. wittmackii because both species are densely pubescent. However, S. contumazaense has long conical fruits and white corollas whereas S. wittmackii has globose fruits and purple corollas.

wfo-0001032308,"Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) cite a collection from Catamarca (Hunziker 19177) as the most southerly locality known for S. venturii; we are expanding its distribution further south by adding a collection from La Rioja. Solanum venturii as been found growing with S. vernei, S. neorossii, S. sanctae-rosae and S. microdontum. Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) cited hybrids with S. sanctae-rosae, although some of these hybrids have the characteristic acute terminal and most distal lateral leaflets of S. sanctae-rosae as well as pale-blue flowers and we have identified them as S. sanctae-rosae - they are: Petersen and Hjerting P56, P326, P327, P333, P334, P336, 839. We identify Venturii 4727 and Sleumer 1839 as S. venturii on the bases of leaf morphology and flower color. We identify the following collections as hybrids with S. neorossii, as these collections present white flowers that have some purple, and intermediate leaf morphology: Hoffman 1563, Okada 4392, 4392C, 4385, 4391, 4404, 7585, 7609, 7633B, 7619A, 7633B, 7456, 7484A, 7618B, 7584B. Collections 7619B, Okada 7609 are probable hybrids with S. vernei. Solanum venturii was described by Hawkes and Hjerting in 1960 (see above) as a species closely related to S. microdontum and distributed in the provinces of Jujuy, Catamarca and Tucumán. Hawkes and Hjerting (1983) described S. okadae on the basis of a specimen from Bolivia; in Argentina its presence was reported from the Provinces of Jujuy and Salta, but no collections were cited from these areas. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) stated that that they originally thought that S. okadae was vigorous and tall, although in its natural habitat it formed small tufts or semi-rosettes with simple uni-jugate leaves; the Argentinean forms of S. okadae are more delicate in leaf and stem compared to the Bolivian ones. Hawkes (1990) stated that S. okadae, S. venturii and S. microdontum were closely related species, but S. venturii could be distinguished from S. okadae by the larger terminal and smaller lateral leaflets. Ochoa (1990), when comparing S. venturii and S. microdontum, stated that S. venturii is taller, more vigorous, larger-flowered and more pubescent than S. microdontum, and stated that the true affinity of S. microdontum is with S. okadae because both present a large terminal leaflet of similar shape, and have sparsely pilose and poorly dissected leaves. Hawkes, Hjerting & Rahn 3742, 3712, 3716, 3741, 3589, 3539, 3540 and 3541 were identified as S. venturii by Hawkes and Hjerting (1969). In their treatment of the Bolivian potatoes, Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) identified Hawkes, Hjerting & Rahn 3742, 3712, 3716 and 3741 as S. okadae while the remaining collections from the southern distribution were not cited. Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) identified Hjerting & Rahn 28 as S. venturii on a herbarium sheet. The same enlarged terminal leaflet, a variable number of laterals and in some cases an obtuse apex was observed in all the above specimens. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) and Ochoa (1990) considered S. okadae to occur in Bolivia, but we disagree and consider the specimens they cited for Bolivia to be S. venturii. Clausen and Ispizúa (2005), when comparing the disjunct populations of S. okadae from Argentina and Bolivia, found that the Bolivian accessions of S. okadae could be differentiated from the Argentinean populations on the bases of larger leaves, larger peduncle, larger calyx, winged stem, and more pairs of lateral leaflets. The Argentinean populations are very similar to what we consider to be S. venturii, and the collections from herbarium BAL were cited as S. venturii in Hawkes (1990). Morphological variability is encountered along its wide distributional range in Argentina, and we identify northern and southern Argentinean populations of “S. okadae” and S. venturii. The name S. okadae should be maintained for the Bolivian populations. Van den Berg and Groendijk-Wilders (2007), included a few populations of S. okadae and S. venturii from Argentina and S. okadae from Bolivia in a wider morphological and AFLP study. Their morphological analysis was not consistent, but their AFLP study showed that the Argentinean populations of S. okadae and S. venturii and clustered together while S. okadae from Bolivia formed a distinct group."
wfo-0001029789,"Solanum neoweberbaueri is similar to S. medians, but it differs by its subglabrous to sparsely pubescent leaves and calyx; the pedicels, which are typically articulate in the middle or slightly below the middle; and the corollas, which are pure white to white and mottled blue or blue to purple with a white star. All populations of S. neoweberbaueri are sterile, never producing fruits or seeds. Ochoa (1999) postulated that S. neoweberbaueri is a sterile triploid nothospecies resulting from hybridization of S. medians, a purple-flowered species found in the lomas vegetation, and S. chancayense, a sympatric white-flowered species. Solanum neoweberbaueri is found in only a small part of the range of these two species."
wfo-0001029417,"Solanum medians is morphologically very similar to some populations of S. oplocense Hawkes, an inland species ranging from central Bolivia to northern Argentina. Correll (1962: 512) identified some collections from Bolivia as S. tacnaense var. sandemanii that we examined and identify as S. oplocense. Both species share similar pubescence, leaf shape, and corolla morphology. Solanum oplocense, however, generally has pedicel articulation at or below the middle, and S. medians is distinct based on AFLP data (Spooner et al. 2005). "
wfo-0001031071,"Solanum scabrifolium is morphologically similar to S. cantense. Both species possess terminal leaflets subequal to the lateral leaflets and are glabrous adaxially.

wfo-0001025637,Solanum ×blanco-galdosii is morphologically similar to S. anamatophilum. Both species possess narrow lanceolate leaflets and lilac to blue corollas. They differ because S. ×blanco-galdosii has interjected leaflets and S. anamatophilum does not. According to Ochoa (1999) S. ×blanco-galdosii is a hybrid species originating from the cross between S. peloquinianum (now S. anamatophilum) and S. chomatophilum.

Both species have white corollas and coriaceous, simple to odd-pinnate leaves with a broadly ovate terminal leaflet much larger than the laterals. Our morphological examination of germplasm collections of these species grown in a greenhouse initially led us to consider them to be conspecific, but nuclear DNA sequence data (Ames, 2008) showed them to be members of distinct clades. This forced us to look for characters to separate them and we found only a red coloration the midvein in the terminal leaflet of S. simplicissimum that differs from S. hypacrarthrum, which has green midveins. This is the first treatment to consider S. guzmanguense as conspecific with S. hypacrarthrum. Ochoa (1999) placed S. guzmanguense in series Simplicissima (with S. simplicissimum) and S. hypacrarthrum in series Piurana, but nuclear DNA sequence data (Ames, 2008) show them to be members of the same clade. Ochoa (1999) distinguished S. guzmanguense by its “conspicuously winged stem, very robust habit, and large simple leaves.” His maps showed a gap in distribution between S. guzmanguense and S. hypacrarthrum, with none of the latter in Cajamarca Department. We found the more typical smaller morphotypes of S. hypacrarthrum in Cajamarca Department and consider S. guzmanguense simply as a large plant of S. hypacrarthrum."

Solanum humectophilum is distributed in northern Peru close to, but not overlapping the distribution of S. andreanum, which is confined to Ecuador and adjacent southern Colombia."
wfo-0001026441,"Hawkes (1990) treated Solanum ayacuchense as one of 40 species in Solanum sect. Petota series Conicibaccata Bitter, a group containing diploids (2n = 24), tetraploids (2n = 48), and hexaploids (2n = 72). The polyploids are mainly distributed from southern Mexico south to central Peru (one species in northern Bolivia), and the diploids from northern Peru to central Bolivia. Solanum ayacuchense is scarce and restricted to the locality of Yanta Yanta in the Department of Ayacucho, Peru. The species boundaries and relationships of members of series Conicibaccata have been studied using plastid DNA restriction sites (Castillo and Spooner, 1997), morphology (Castillo and Spooner, 1997; Fajardo et al., 2008), AFLPs (Jiménez et al., 2008), nuclear DNA (waxy) sequence data (Spooner et al., 2008), other nuclear DNA sequence data (Fajardo & Spooner 2011), and monographic studies (Hawkes, 1990; Hawkes and Hjerting, 1989; Ochoa, 1990, 1999). The plastid DNA restriction site and morphological data divide the diploids and polyploids into two clades or phenetic groups, respectively, but the morphological separation generally depends on the use of character states that sometimes overlap in range. The DNA sequence data show the polyploids to be of allopolyploid origin from the diploid members of the series and members of species outside of the series. A monographic study in progress by Fajardo and Spooner, using the above data, and herbarium specimens, will recognize only 17 species. All are very similar, united as a group by conical fruits, leaves with generally parallel-sided morphology, and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. However, some unrelated species also have conical fruits, such as the Mexican diploid species S. hintonii Correll, S. lesteri Hawkes and Hjert. and S. trifidum Correll; the Mexican hexaploid species S. iopetalum (Bitter) Hawkes; and the Bolivian species S. circaeifolium Bitter. An additional problem is that some species possess ovoid fruits that are not absolutely distinct from the conical fruits of the above species or the globose fruits more common in the majority of the members of sect. Petota. Solanum ayacuchense is characterized by its long petiolules (6-15 mm long), ovate to elliptic-lanceolate terminal leaflet, glabrous calyx and small rotate pale violet corolla. Ochoa (1982) provides the first chromosome count (2n = 2x = 24) of this species, and repeats it in Ochoa (1999), but cites no voucher.

wfo-0001029546,"Many populations of S. microdontum are distinguished by simple leaves, but intra- and interpopulational variability encompasses morphotypes with pinnately compound leaves more similar to those of other wild species. This variability has been partitioned into six species, three subspecies, and six varieties, but recent classifications reduced this variability to one species with two subspecies: subspecies microdontum and subspecies gigantophyllum (Hawkes, 1990) or three varieties, variety microdontum, variety metriophyllum Bitter, and variety montepuncoense (Ochoa, 1990). Phenetic analysis of morphological data (Van den Berg and Spooner, 1992) showed these infraspecific taxa to be unwarranted. Variety microdontum and variety metriophyllum are equivalent nomenclaturally to subspecies microdontum and subspecies gigantophyllum, respectively. Variety montepuncoense was distinguished by rotate corollas white tinged with blue and, but is known only from a single locality and otherwise appears to be S. microdontum. Van den Berg and Spooner (1992) synonymized all of these names, except variety montepuncoense which we now synonymize in S. microdontum. "

Hawkes & Hjerting (1989) subsequently reversed their opinion regarding the hybrid origin of S. berthaultii, but continued to hypothesize extensive hybridization between S. berthaultii and S. tarijense. Fifteen percent of the S. berthaultii and S. tarijense accessions listed in Hanneman & Bamberg (1986) and 24% of the specimens cited in Hawkes & Hjerting (1989) are listed as natural interspecific S. berthaultii x S. tarijense hybrids. Further mention of these here will be ""hybrids"" for simplicity. Until 2007 (Spooner et al., 2007) Solanum berthaultii and S. tarijense were recognized as distinct species, since their original description by Hawkes in 1944. A morphological study of Spooner & van den Berg (1992) questioned the validity of separate species status for S. berthaultii and S. tarijense. Multivariate analyses of morphological data failed to support separate species, showing great overlap of three “species-specific” characters used to separate the species (presence/absence Type B trichomes [long-stalked glandular trichomes], corolla color, corolla shape), and a geographic analysis of these characters showed them to be distributed throughout the range of both species. For example, intra-accession variability for presence/absence of Type B trichomes was encountered in eight of the 64 accessions examined. Corolla colors varied continuously from pure white to dark-blue, and plants from only one geographic area in the extreme south of Salta Province had all corollas pure white (a S. tarijense character, but most of these accessions possessed Type B trichomes, a S. berthaultii character). Corolla colors and shapes exhibited no statistically significant differences between any of the taxa. Hawkes & Hjerting (1989) designated K as the deposition of the holotype of S. berthaultii, but we did not find a sheet designated as holotype despite our extensive searches there. The locality of Solanum vallegrandense is a correction provided in Hawkes & Hjerting, 1989: 144, 258, by pers. comm. from M. Cárdenas, of erroneous locality data originally reported on specimens and in the protologue, reported as “on way from Trigal to Mataral, 2000 m.” Many collections of Hawkes and his collaborators were deposited at the Commonwealth Potato Collection (CPC) herbarium in Dundee Scotland, and Correll took many photos of these. All of these collections were widely distributed to other herbaria but we were not able to locate all of the specimens that match the photos."

Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) suggested that S. doddsii was a natural hybrid between S. alandiae and S. chacoense, and Ochoa (1990) noted similarities to S. alandiae without mentioning a hybrid origin or mentioning S. chacoense. Solanum doddsii is narrowly distributed in central Bolivia and grows near populations of S. alandiae, S. berthaultii, and S. chacoense. Our collections in Bolivia in 1993 and 1994 (Spooner et al., 1994) noted great variation in this species with corollas varying in shape from stellate to pentagonal, and in color from white tinged with blue to light blue throughout. It is similar to S. chacoense,which also has this corolla shape variation, but has corollas white or creamy white. It is also similar to S. alandiae, which has 2-3 pairs of lateral leaflets with the most distal lateral leaflet pair frequently decurrent on the rachis, in contrast to S. chacoense with 3-5 pairs of lateral leaflets and all pairs petiolulate.

An additional problem is that some species possess ovoid fruits that are not absolutely distinct from the conical fruits of the above species or the globose fruits more common in the majority of the members of sect. Petota. Solanum colombianum is by far the most widely distributed and polymorphic polyploid member of the series, composed of both tetraploid cytotypes (such as the previous name S. colombianum and others), and the hexaploid cytotypes S. moscapanum, S. sucubunense and S. tundalomense. Relative to the other South American polyploids, S. colombianum may be a plesiospecies (sensu Rieseberg and Brouillet, 1994; Olmstead, 1995), with the other sympatric polyploids (S. flahaultii Bitter, S. garcia-barrigae Ochoa, and S. lobbianum Bitter) as phenetically distinctive local derivatives. Its polymorphism and possible plesiomorphic species status make it hard to define, and is best differentiated from other polyploids by lack of characters that define them. These include, for example, the lack of a seed spot found in S. longiconicum, lack of an enlarged or differently shaped terminal leaflet in comparison to lateral leaflets as in S. garcia-barrigae or S. pillahuatense, lack of densely pubescent leaves as in S. lobbianum. Dunal (1852) described S. otites based on Linden 426 in the Boissier Herbarium at G. There are two specimens of Linden 426 at G but only one bears Dunal's handwriting that we consider as holotype. Both of these specimens have three pairs of lateral leaflets (3-jugate) We consider duplicates of this collection at BR, FI, G, OXF and P as isotypes. Bitter (1912) redescribed S. otites as a species both 2- and 3-jugate, but described two forms (forma dizygum and forma trizygum) differing in this character.

wfo-0001025792,"Cultivated potatoes are taxonomically difficult, and cultivated potatoes have been classified very differently by different taxonomists. Indigenous cultivated (landrace) potatoes are grown throughout mid to high (about 3000-3500 m) elevations in the Andes from western Venezuela to northern Argentina, and then in lowland south-central Chile, concentrated in the Chonos Archipelago. Landrace populations in Mexico and Central America are recent, post-Columbian introductions (Ugent, 1968). The landraces are highly diverse, with a great variety of shapes and skin and tuber colors not often seen in modern varieties. The taxonomic treatment of Solanum tuberosum used here follows Spooner et al. (2007b) that divide cultivated potato species into four species: S. tuberosum, S. ajanhuiri Juz. and Bukasov, S. curtilobum Juz. and Bukasov, and S. juzepczukii Bukasov. The widely used recent classification of Hawkes (1990) divided cultivated potato into seven species and seven subspecies. Hawkes’ (1990) treatment was not universally accepted. The Russian potato taxonomists Bukasov (1971) and Lechnovich (1971) recognized 21 species. Ochoa (1990, 1999) recognized nine species and 141 infraspecific taxa for the Bolivian cultivated species alone. Bukasov (1971), Lechnovich (1971), Hawkes (1990), and Ochoa (1990) classified potatoes as distinct species under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) (McNeill et al., 2006). Dodds (1962), in contrast, treated the cultivated species under the International Code of Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (ICNCP) (Bricknell et al., 2005). Dodds (1962) suggested that there was poor morphological support for most cultivated species, and recognized only S. ×curtilobum, S. ×juzepczukii, and S. tuberosum, with five “groups” recognized in the latter. “Cultivar-groups” (the current terminology) are taxonomic categories used by the ICNCP to associate cultivated plants with traits that are of use to agriculturists. The cultivar-group classification of Dodds (1962) was based on comparative morphology, reproductive biology, cytological and genetic data, and cultural practices. He contended that the morphological characters used by Hawkes (1956a) to separate species exaggerated the consistency of qualitative and quantitative characters. Ploidy level has been of great importance in the classification and identification of cultivated potatoes. Bukasov (1939) was the first to count chromosomes of the cultivated potatoes and discovered diploids, triploids, tetraploids, and pentaploids and used these data to speculate on their hybrid origins. In historical and current practice, identifications are frequently made only after chromosome counts are determined, and re-identifications made after chromosome counts do not match that expected for the species. The strong reliance on ploidy levels was clearly stated by Hawkes and Hjerting (1989, p. 389): “The chromosome number of 2n = 36 largely helps to identify S. chaucha, but morphological characters can also be used.” Huamán and Spooner (2002) examined the morphological support for the classification of landrace populations of cultivated potatoes, using representatives of all seven species and most subspecies as outlined in the taxonomic treatment of Hawkes (1990). The results showed some phenetic support for S. ajanhuiri, S. chaucha, S. curtilobum, S. juzepczukii, and S. tuberosum subsp. tuberosum, but little support for the other taxa. Most morphological support is only present by using a suite of characters, all of which are shared with other taxa. These results, combined with their likely hybrid origins and evolutionary dynamics of continuing hybridization led Huamán and Spooner (2002) to recognize all landrace populations of cultivated potatoes as a single species, S. tuberosum, with the eight cultivar-groups: Ajanhuiri Group, Andigena Group, Chaucha Group, Chilotanum Group, Curtilobum Group, Juzepczukii Group, Phureja Group, and Stenotomum Group.

wfo-0001029299,"Mitotic chromosome counts made by Clausen of two of populations of S. maglia in Argentina (Clausen & Masuelli 869, 870) were diploid (2n = 24), in agreement with prior reports from the Argentinean populations (Brücher, 1965; Hawkes and Hjerting, 1969). Some Chilean populations are triploid (2n = 3x = 36) that reproduce only by tubers (Hawkes and Hjerting, 1969). Contreras (1987) did not report chromosome counts of the accessions held at the gene bank of the Universidad Austral de Chile. Spooner et al. (1991) collected tubers of S. maglia suspected to be triploid because the flowers dropped before producing fruits. Solanum maglia has an interesting distribution. Most Chilean populations are in isolated moist habitats along the coast of Chile, and in Argentina it grown in a single valley in Argentina, Mendoza Province, Quebrada de Alvarado, at the base of the Andes Mountains (Hawkes and Hjerting, 1969; Contreras, 1987; Spooner et al., 1991). The populations in Argentina flowered freely, but no fruits were found. The only other tuber-bearing species growing in the vicinity of S. maglia in Argentina is S. kurtzianum, but usually in the Monte phytogeographical province, although recently Masuelli (pers. com) reported the finding of S. kurtzianum within this Quebrada. Clausen and Masuelli made five collections of S. maglia along a distance of 5 km in the Quebrada de Alvarado, between 1630 and 1820 m (Spooner and Clausen, 1993). The plants were profusely flowering but not bearing fruits, and only tubers could be collected. Attempts to produce seeds by crossing the accessions brought into cultivation in a field station in Balcarce Argentina were unsuccessful. Crossability studies of these accessions of S. maglia with S. kurtzianum were carried out by Ispizúa, et al. (1999). Solanum maglia is distinguished by its relatively broad leaflets, especially the terminal leaflet, and by its anthers with the tissue grading into the filaments rather than with distinct filaments."
wfo-0001026946,"Solanum chacoense is one of the most variable and widely-distributed wild potato species. It is most similar morphologically to S. kurtzianum and S. malmeanum. From S. kurtzianum it is distinguished by its non-ciliate leaf margins, its generally greater height of up to 2 m, and the generally obtuse angle of insertion of the first distal pair of lateral leaflets. From S. malmeanum, it can be differentiated by its larger and erect habit, by the acute apex of the terminal leaflet and generally by a larger peduncle. Solanum chacoense also is similar to S. berthaultii but can be distinguished from that species by the absence of type B (long-stalked) glandular trichomes, by its less pubescent leaves, and its consistently white to creamy-white corollas.  Hawkes and Hjerting (1969), Morton (1976), and Hawkes (1990) considered S. muelleri as a subspecies of S. chacoense and distinguished this subspecies by broader lateral leaflets (3 to 4 times as long as broad). Matesevach and Barboza (2005) synonymized subspecies muelleri under S. chacoense but Correll (1962) and Mentz and Oliveira (2004) consider it at the species level as based upon the following characters: stem unwinged, the absence of a rosette of basal leaves, larger lateral leaflets, no presence of interjected leaflets and if present only 0.2 cm, and irregular acumens. Matesevach and Barboza (2005) synonymized it under S. chacoense but considered material only from Argentina. We examined specimens of S. chacoense along its entire range and found it to be a highly variable species, although easily recognizable on the bases of leaf and flower morphology. Considering the characters listed by Mentz and Oliveira (2004) based upon specimens from Brazil, we found that the absence of wings, larger lateral leaflets, lack of interjected leaflets or small interjected leaflets, and irregular acumens occur throughout its entire range. Solanum calvescens has been differentiated from other tuber bearing species on the basis of very small acumens, anthers not clearly delimited from the filaments, flowers white or purple, and triploid ploidy (Correll, 1962; Hawkes and Hjerting, 1969). Both authors stressed the particular stamens of S. calvescens, similar to S. maglia, not being basally cordate. While the stamens of plants identified as S. calvescens are somewhat atypical, they are not like S. maglia that possess “barrel” shaped stamens without a clear distinction between stamens and filaments. The specific characters observed in the stamens S. calvescens points partly towards the characteristic form of a male sterile plant: small, distorted and pale. Along its wide distribution, S. chacoense has been found growing with S. kurtzianum, S. microdontum, S. tarijense, and S. spegazzinii. Hybrids have been reported between several of these species. Solanum chacoense was the first tuber-bearing species investigated for introgressive hybridization. Hawkes (1962) considered that hybridization with S. microdontum in northwest Argentina might be responsible for its extended distribution at higher altitudes. Juned et al. (1988) studied populations from Paraguay and Argentina using morphological and isozyme markers and found that introgression could not explain the range of variation detected in Córdoba province. They proposed that regional diversity and clinal variation according to altitude were responsible for the detected variability. Miller and Spooner (1996) investigated the hybrid nature of upland populations of S. chacoense using morphological and molecular data (RAPDs and RFLPs). They distinguished upland from lowland populations on the basis of morphological data; this was partially supported by RAPDs but not by RFLP data. Introgressive hybridization with other species does not appear to be responsible for the variability observed in S. chacoense."

wfo-0001026656,"The Solanum brevicaule complex has long attracted the attention of biologists because of its close relationships and breeding value to cultivated potatoes, and the perplexing taxonomic problems associated with its circumscription (Correll 1962; Grun 1990; Ugent 1970). As described below, we here recognize two species in this complex, one from the “northern” part (as S. candolleanum in central and southern Peru, barely into northwestern Bolivia), the other from the “southern” part (S. brevicaule from northern Bolivia to central Argentina). Some members of this complex, endemic to central Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina, were considered ancestors of the landraces of the cultivated potato (Ugent, 1970). The species of the complex share pinnately dissected leaves, round fruits, rotate to rotate-pentagonal corollas, and are largely sexually compatible with each other and with cultivated potato (Hawkes, 1958; Hawkes & Hjerting 1969, 1989; Ochoa 1990, 1999). Solanum candolleanum is exclusively diploid, and S. brevicaule includes diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids, with some species recognized by Hawkes (1990) possessing multiple ploidy levels (S. gourlayi with diploids and tetraploids; and S. oplocense with diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids). Members of the complex are so similar that even experienced potato taxonomists Hawkes & Hjerting (1989) and Ochoa (1990) provided different identifications for identical collection numbers of the S. brevicaule complex in fully 38% of the cases (Spooner et al., 1994). Field studies in Argentina (Spooner & Clausen 1993), Bolivia (Spooner et al. 1994), and Peru (Spooner et al. 1999; Salas et al. 2001), phenetic analyses of morphological data from common garden studies in the United States (van den Berg et al. 1998) and Peru (Alvarez et al. 2008), single- to low-copy nuclear restriction fragment length polymorphism and random amplified fragment length (RAPD) data (Miller & Spooner 1999), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data (Spooner et al. 2005) failed to clearly differentiate many wild species in the complex, but defined two geographic subsets: (1) a “northern” group composed of the Peruvian populations (including S. achacacense and S. candolleanum from extreme western Bolivia near the Peruvian border), (2) a “southern” group of Bolivian and Argentinean populations. In all data sets, however, even these two groups could be distinguished only by computer-assisted analysis of widely overlapping character states, and not by species-specific diagnostic characters. The AFLP data provided the best species-specific support, with all accessions of S. candolleanum of the northern S. brevicaule complex forming a clade. Multiple accessions of S. avilesii, S. hoopesii, S. incamayoense, S. spegazzinii, S. ugentii, and S. vidaurrei also formed clades, but support for each was low, with bootstrap values below 50%, and was not concordant with the morphological results that could not reliably distinguish the species. An exception was S. spegazzinii, the southern-most representative of the southern S. brevicaule complex that showed all eight examined accessions forming a monophyletic group with 74% bootstrap value using AFLPs (Spooner et al. 2005). Solanum spegazzinii has never been questioned as a valid species and can sometimes be differentiated from other members of the southern members of the S. brevicaule complex by the presence of a larger number of interjected leaflets (5-15) and generally by five subequal pairs of lateral leaflets, but these are very inconstant features. Furthermore, S. spegazzinii was indistinguishable by morphological ? phenetic studies (van den Berg et al. 1998). An opposite problem was S. oplocense, that was somewhat distinct using morphological data from plants grown in the United States (van den Berg et al. 1998), but not from plants grown in Peru (Alvarez et al. 2008) nor with AFLP data (van den Berg et al. 1998). Morphologically many populations can be defined by finely denticulate leaf margins, glaucous leaves with frequently purple leaf nerves, and a long exserted style. But these features are widely scattered through the complex and the maintenance of this species would result in unstable identifications. Brücher (1964) considered S. setulosistylum as identical with S. chacoense and not a hybrid of S. chacoense with S. leptophyes or S. spegazzinii, as stated by Hawkes (1956). Brücher (1964) also stated that S. setulosistylum was not related to S. puberulofructum as assumed by Correll (1962). Hawkes and Hjerting (1969) considered S. setulosistylum and S. puberulofructum to be hybrids between S. chacoense Bitter and S. spegazzinii. Brücher stated that it was not possible to consider S. sleumeri and S. puberulofructum as different species. We have analyzed many collections identified as these species in the literature or on herbarium sheets and consider that they are synonymous with our broad definition of S. brevicaule. One of the collections of S. setulosistylum cited by Correll (Brücher 534) has a pubescent berry, a character thought to distinguish S. puberulofructum.  Populations identified as Solanum spegazzinii are extremely variable. Ispizúa (1994) studied specimens from much of the range of the group and documented three somewhat intergrading morphotypes based on multivariate analysis of 42 morphological characters: 1) populations from Tafí del Valle in Tucumán Province and in central Salta Province near Rosario de Lerma and Chicoana, 2) populations along the length of Quebrada Calchaquí from eastern Catamarca Province near Santa Maria north to Cachi and La Poma in central Salta Province, 3) populations in south-central Catamarca Province around Belén. Specimens from area 1 are characterized by relatively narrow leaflets. Specimens from areas 2 and 3 have wider leaflets and are similar morphologically except for the dense pubescence of leaves and fruits that characterize specimens from area 2. The type of the densely pubescent S. puberulofructum [that we synonymize here], however, is found in area 3 where no pubescent collections were found. Erazzú et al. (1999) made crosses within and among different accessions of S. spegazzinii from these three areas, and assessed reproductive success by seed set and observation of pollen tube inhibition in stigmas and styles. They found no crossing barriers within accessions from area 1, but sometimes no but also intermediate to high crossing barriers within areas 2 and 3 and crosses among accessions of the three areas. They attributed these crossing barriers to interspecific hybridization with other sympatric species such as S. acaule, S. chacoense, S. berthaultii [as S. tarijense], S. sanctae-rosae, and S. vernei, and suggest that these species are maintained as distinct by eventual selection against maladapted hybrid combinations. We entered into our monographic studies influenced by all of these results, and the AFLP data led us to consider recognizing S. candolleanum as a northern Bolivian representative of the complex, and S. avilesii, S. hoopesii, S. incamayoense, S. spegazzinii, S. ugentii, and S. vidaurrei as southern representatives. However, like the morphological results of living representatives in common gardens (van den Berg et al. 1998; Alvarez et al. 2008), we found it impossible to identify many collections of these southern “species” with herbarium specimen data. The only way we could provide species-level identifications was to use determinations of prior taxonomists (which differed considerably, see above), or inferences from distributional data. We conclude that populations of the complex are sometimes partly differentiated into phenetically distinguishable units, but that clear boundaries among taxa are confounded by recent and only partial species divergence, introgression, hybridization, and allopolyploidy (Spooner et al., 2008; Rodríguez & Spooner, 2009). We also conclude that molecular marker support for some taxa (as seen in the case of S. spegazzinii) signals divergence through geographical isolation, but that this is not yet accompanied by traits needed for practical species recognition such as morphological divergence or breeding barriers. Despite our extensive synonymy based on the impracticality of morphological data to distinguish these species, and of low statistical support with the AFLP data, we recognize the northern (S. candolleanum) and southern (S. brevicaule) components of the S. brevicaule complex as distinct species, despite their extreme similarity, because all morphological and molecular data sets support them. In a practical sense they can be distinguished largely by geography. Our key is our best attempt to separate them based on insights from the replicated field trials (van den Berg et al. 1998; Alvarez et al. 2008) and herbarium specimens, but this will often fail. The extensive synonymy we propose for S. brevicaule and S. candolleanum may appear extreme to those accustomed to these long-accepted species names, but was at least partly expected by us based on our prior studies. We suspect that our synonymy will be questioned by those using molecular marker data, but we suggest that such workers wishing to resurrect our synonymized names do so only with morphological data needed to support the identification of these species in realistic and practical ways. Without such data, we envision the perpetuation of alternative taxonomies, variant identifications by different workers, and the maintenance of unstable names and taxonomic confusion in these important but taxonomically confusing species related to the cultivated potato."
wfo-0001030057,"Solanum okadae can be identified by its white rotate to rotate pentagonal corollas, Leaves sparsely pubescent, generally smaller than S. microdontum, 2-4 mm wide at base, and plants 20-80 cm tall; leaves 7-14 cm wide; in contrast to plants 18-25 cm tall; leaves 4.8-7 mm wide; as in S. venturii. Hawkes and Hjerting (1983) described S. okadae on the basis of specimens from Bolivia, (Depts. Cochabamba and La Paz) and from Argentina (Provs. Jujuy and Salta), but they failed to cite collections from Argentina. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) stated that that they originally thought that S. okadae was vigorous and tall, although in its natural habitat it formed small tufts or semi-rosettes with simple leaves or leaves with only one set of lateral leaflets. Hawkes (1990) stated that S. okadae, S. venturii and S. microdontum were closely related species, but S. venturii could be distinguished from S. okadae by the larger terminal and smaller lateral leaflets. Ochoa (1990), when comparing S. venturii and S. microdontum, stated that S. venturii is taller, more vigorous, larger-flowered and more pubescent than S. microdontum, and stated that the true affinity of S. microdontum is with S. okadae because both present a large terminal leaflet of similar shape, and have sparsely pilose and poorly dissected leaves. Clausen and Ispizúa (2005), when comparing the disjunct populations of S. okadae from Bolivia and from Argentina found that the Bolivian accessions of S. okadae could be differentiated from the Argentinean populations on the bases of larger leaves, larger peduncle, larger calyx, winged stem, and more pairs of lateral leaflets. We identify the Argentinean populations thought to be S. okadae as S. venturii and the Bolivian populations as S. okadae. Van den Berg and Groendijk-Wilders (2007), included a few populations of S. okadae and S. venturii from Argentina and S. okadae from Bolivia in a wider morphological and AFLP study. Their morphological analysis was not consistent, but their AFLP study showed that the Argentinean populations of S. okadae and S. venturii clustered together while S. okadae from Bolivia formed a distinct group.

Both triploid and diploid cytotypes of S. microdontum have been shown to hybridize with S. kurtzianum in the Famatina Mountains in Prov. La Rioja, Argentina. These hybrids were first described as S. rechei (Hawkes, 1963) but it was later shown that S. rechei was an interspecific hybrid that propagates mainly by tubers and is common in disturbed habitats in the Famatina Mountains (Okada and Hawkes, 1978).

The polyploids are mainly distributed from southern Mexico south to central Peru (one species in northern Bolivia), and the diploids from northern Peru to central Bolivia. The species boundaries and relationships of members of series Conicibaccata have been studied using plastid DNA restriction sites (Castillo and Spooner, 1997), morphology (Castillo and Spooner, 1997; Fajardo et al., 2008), AFLPs (Jiménez et al., 2008), nuclear DNA (waxy) sequence data (Spooner et al., 2008), other nuclear DNA sequence data (Fajardo & Spooner 2011), and monographic studies (Hawkes, 1990; Hawkes and Hjerting, 1989; Ochoa, 1990, 1999). The plastid DNA restriction site and morphological data divide the diploids and polyploids into two clades or phenetic groups, respectively, but the morphological separation generally depends on the use of character states that sometimes overlap in range. The DNA sequence data show the polyploids to be of allopolyploid origin from the diploid members of the series and members of species outside of the series. A monographic study in progress by Fajardo and Spooner, using the above data, and herbarium specimens, will recognize only 17 species. All are very similar, united as a group by conical fruits, leaves with generally parallel-sided morphology, and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. However, some unrelated species also have conical fruits, such as the Mexican diploid species S. hintonii Correll, S. lesteri Hawkes and Hjert. and S. trifidum Correll; the Mexican hexaploid species S. iopetalum (Bitter) Hawkes; and the Bolivian species S. circaeifolium Bitter. An additional problem is that some species possess ovoid fruits that are not absolutely distinct from the conical fruits of the above species or the globose fruits more common in the majority of the members of sect. Petota.

wfo-0001026819,"The Solanum brevicaule complex has long attracted the attention of biologists because of its close relationships and breeding value to cultivated potatoes, and the perplexing taxonomic problems associated with its circumscription (Correll 1962; Grun 1990; Ugent 1970). As described below, we here recognize two species in this complex, one from the northern part (as S. candolleanum in central and southern Peru, barely into northwestern Bolivia), and the other from the southern part (S. brevicaule from northern Bolivia to central Argentina). Some members of this complex, endemic to central Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina, were considered ancestors of the landraces of the cultivated potato (Ugent, 1970). The species of the complex share pinnately dissected leaves, round fruits, rotate to rotate-pentagonal corollas, and are largely sexually compatible with each other and with cultivated potato (Hawkes, 1958; Hawkes & Hjerting 1969, 1989; Ochoa 1990, 1999). Solanum candolleanum is exclusively diploid, and S. brevicaule includes diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids, with some species recognized by Hawkes (1990) possessing multiple ploidy levels (S. gourlayi with diploids and tetraploids; and S. oplocense with diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids). Members of the complex are so similar that even experienced potato taxonomists Hawkes & Hjerting (1989) and Ochoa (1990) provided different identifications for identical collection numbers of the S. brevicaule complex in fully 38% of the cases (Spooner et al., 1994). Field studies in Argentina (Spooner & Clausen 1993), Bolivia (Spooner et al. 1994), and Peru (Spooner et al. 1999; Salas et al. 2001), phenetic analyses of morphological data from common garden studies in the United States (van den Berg et al. 1998) and Peru (Alvarez et al. 2008), single- to low-copy nuclear restriction fragment length polymorphism and random amplified fragment length (RAPD) data (Miller & Spooner 1999), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data (Spooner et al. 2005) failed to clearly differentiate many wild species in the complex, but defined two geographic subsets: (1) a northern group composed of the Peruvian populations (to including S. achacacense and S. candolleanum from extreme western Bolivia near the Peruvian border), (2) a southern group of Bolivian and Argentinean populations. In all data sets, however, even these two groups could be distinguished only by computer-assisted analysis of widely overlapping character states, and not by species-specific diagnostic characters. The AFLP data provided the best species-specific support, with all accessions of S. candolleanum of the northern S. brevicaule complex forming a clade. Multiple accessions of S. avilesii, S. hoopesii, S. incamayoense, S. spegazzinii, S. ugentii, and S. vidaurrei also formed clades, but support for each was low, with bootstrap values below 50%, and was not concordant with the morphological results that could not reliably distinguish the species. An exception was S. spegazzinii, the southern-most representative of the southern S. brevicaule complex that showed all eight examined accessions forming a monophyletic group with 74% bootstrap value using AFLPs (Spooner et al. 2005). Solanum spegazzinii has never been questioned as a valid species and can sometimes be differentiated from other members of the southern members of the S. brevicaule complex by the presence of a larger number of interjected leaflets (5-15) and generally by five subequal pairs of lateral leaflets, but these are very inconstant features. Furthermore, S. spegazzinii was indistinguishable by morphological? phenetic studies (van den Berg et al. 1998). An opposite problem was S. oplocense, that was somewhat distinct using morphological data from plants grown in the United States (van den Berg et al. 1998), but not from plants grown in Peru (Alvarez et al. 2008) nor with AFLP data (van den Berg et al. 1998). Morphologically many populations can be defined by finely denticulate leaf margins, glaucous leaves with frequently purple leaf nerves, and a long exserted style. But these features are widely scattered through the complex and the maintenance of this species would result in unstable identifications.

Populations identified as Solanum spegazzinii are extremely variable. Ispizúa (1994) studied specimens from much of the range of the group and documented three somewhat intergrading morphotypes based on multivariate analysis of 42 morphological characters: 1) populations from Tafí del Valle in Tucumán Province and in central Salta Province near Rosario de Lerma and Chicoana, 2) populations along the length of Quebrada Calchaquí from eastern Catamarca Province near Santa Maria north to Cachi and La Poma in central Salta Province, 3) populations in south-central Catamarca Province around Belén. Specimens from area 1 are characterized by relatively narrow leaflets. Specimens from areas 2 and 3 have wider leaflets and are similar morphologically except for the dense pubescence of leaves and fruits that characterize specimens from area 2. The type of the densely pubescent S. puberulofructum [that we synonymize here], however, is found in area 3 where no pubescent collections were found. Erazzú et al. (1999) made crosses within and among different accessions of S. spegazzinii from these three areas, and assessed reproductive success by seed set and observation of pollen tube inhibition in stigmas and styles. They found no crossing barriers within accessions from area 1, but sometimes no but also intermediate to high crossing barriers within areas 2 and 3 and crosses among accessions of the three areas. They attributed these crossing barriers to interspecific hybridization with other sympatric species such as S. acaule, S. chacoense, S. berthaultii [as S. tarijense], S. sanctae-rosae, and S. vernei, and suggest that these species are maintained as distinct by eventual selection against maladapted hybrid combinations. We entered into our monographic studies influenced by all of these results, and the AFLP data led us to consider recognizing S. candolleanum as a northern Bolivian representative of the complex, and S. avilesii, S. hoopesii, S. incamayoense, S. spegazzinii, S. ugentii, and S. vidaurrei as southern representatives. However, like the morphological results of living representatives in common gardens (van den Berg et al. 1998; Alvarez et al. 2008), we found it impossible to identify many collections of these southern species with herbarium specimen data. The only way we could provide species-level identifications was to use determinations of prior taxonomists (which differed considerably, see above), or inferences from distributional data. We conclude that populations of the complex are sometimes partly differentiated into phenetically distinguishable units, but that clear boundaries among taxa are confounded by recent and only partial species divergence, introgression, hybridization, and allopolyploidy (Spooner et al., 2008; Rodríguez & Spooner, 2009). We also conclude that molecular marker support for some taxa (as seen in the case of S. spegazzinii) signals divergence through geographical isolation, but that this is not yet accompanied by traits needed for practical species recognition such as morphological divergence or breeding barriers. Despite our extensive synonymy based on the impracticality of morphological data to distinguish these species, and of low statistical support with the AFLP data, we recognize the northern (S. candolleanum) and southern (S. brevicaule) components of the S. brevicaule complex as distinct species, despite their extreme similarity, because all morphological and molecular data sets support them. In a practical sense they can be distinguished largely by geography. Our key is our best attempt to separate them based on insights from the replicated field trials (van den Berg et al. 1998; Alvarez et al. 2008) and herbarium specimens, but this will often fail. The extensive synonymy we propose for S. candolleanum and S. brevicaule may appear extreme to those accustomed to these long-accepted species names, but was at least partly expected by us based on our prior studies. We suspect that our synonymy will be questioned by those using molecular marker data, but we suggest that such workers wishing to resurrect our synonymized names do so only with morphological data needed to support the identification of these species in realistic and practical ways. Without such data, we envision the perpetuation of alternative taxonomies, variant identifications by different workers, and the maintenance of unstable names and taxonomic confusion in these important but taxonomically confusing species related to the cultivated potato."

wfo-0001029041,"Solanum leptocaulon is a semi-prostrate, straggly shrub of high elevations mostly from northern Bolivia; Jardim 829 (Parque Nacional Tunari in Bolivia) is unusual in being recorded as a shrub 1 m high. It is similar to both S. albescens and S. dianthum, both also from the Bolivian Andes, and in the past specimens of these three taxa have been annotated as one or the other species somewhat chaotically. Solanum leptocaulon differs from S. albescens in its leaves with uniform short, stiff white pubescence (versus glabrous with longer curling trichomes confined to the stems and leaf margins), smaller corollas (1.1.2 cm long versus 1.5–1.8 cm long) and triangular calyx lobes (versus calyx lobes with somewhat fleshy expanded tips). Both species have campanulate flowers and anthers of more or less the same size, but the larger corollas of S. albescens make the anthers seem smaller. Solanum dianthum is a shrub to 2 m high and often has geminate leaves, and like S. leptocaulon has even pubescence on stems and leaves. The most striking difference between S. leptocaulon and S. dianthum is the corolla shape; S. leptocaulon has campanulate corollas, while those of S. dianthum are stellate with distinct deltate lobes. The anthers of S. leptocaulon are shorter than those of S. dianthum (2.5–3 mm long versus 3.5–5 mm long). Fruits and seeds of S. leptocaulon are not known."

wfo-0001029746,"Solanum nava is an extremely rare plant, and was thought to be extinct until collected in 1973 and 1982 in the laurel forests of Taborno on the Anaga Peninsula of the island of Tenerife (Francisco-Ortega et al. 1993). Considered by Dunal (1852) as a member of his subsection Tuberarium (potatoes and relatives), S. nava and its close relative S. trisectum of Madeira were considered as a distinct section of Solanum by Bitter (1912, 1917). Francisco-Ortega et al. (1993) recognised these two species as the genus Normania, differentiated from Solanum on the basis of the horned anthers, zygomorphic flowers, and distinct seed and pollen morphology. Molecular studies indicate that these species (and their close relative S. herculeum, previously recognised as the genus Triguera) form a distinct clade within a larger, monophyletic Solanum (Bohs & Olmstead, 2001). Solanum nava can be distinguished from S. trisectum by its ovate leaves with cordate bases, its less glandular parts and its black anthers with horns about halfway from the base. The species is endemic to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands; the specimen from the island of São Miguel in the Azores is likely to be an introduction (J.R. Press, pers. comm.). "
wfo-0001027812,"Solanum enantiophyllanthum is morphologically similar to S. paucidens with which it is broadly sympatric. Solanum enantiophyllanthum occurs within the larger range of S. paucidens, but at higher (usually above 2,000 m) elevations. The species can be distinguished by inflorescence morphology and anther length; S. enantiophyllanthum has flowers clustered at the tip of the (usually) unbranched inflorescence and anthers 4.5–6 mm long, while flowers of S. paucidens are spaced along the inflorescence axis and anthers are 2.5–3.5 mm long. The fruiting pedicels of S. paucidens are strongly curved at the base, making the infructescence appear somewhat secund, while those of S. enantiophyllanthum are merely deflexed. The subumbellate inflorescences of large flowers and deflexed fruiting pedicels make S. enantiophyllanthum somewhat like S. macrotonum of northern South America, Central America and the Caribbean. The species differ in distribution, but also in flower size (corollas 1–2 cm in diameter, anthers 3–4 mm long in S. macrotonum versus corollas 1.9–2 cm in diameter, anthers 4.5–6 mm long in S. enantiophyllanthum), calyx lobe morphology (broadly deltate in S. macrotonum versus narrowly deltate in S. enantiophyllanthum) and in the number of stone cells in the berry (usually more than four in S. macrotonum, strictly four in S. enantiophyllanthum)."
wfo-0001025813,"The taxonomy of S. acaule and S. albicans has been a state of flux. Solanum acaule used to include S. albicans as a subspecies (see synonymy above). We do not partition S. acaule into infraspecific categories as do Correll (1962), Hawkes (1990), and Ochoa (1999), and recognize S. albicans at the species level. The status of S. acaule subsp. palmirense is problematic. Kardolus (1998) described this as the first known hexaploid cytotype of S. acaule, based on a single collection from Chimborazo Province, Ecuador (Spooner et al. 5070). At that time, this was the only known Ecuadorian collection of either S. acaule or S. albicans, but we have recently found another collection of S. albicans from the same province (Ochoa 13395). Kardolus (1998) classified subsp. palmirense in S. acaule, rather than in S. albicans, based on Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) affinities of the former, despite the fact that its ploidy was the same and its morphology was a near match for S. albicans. A subsequent AFLP study by McGregor et al. (2002) also grouped subsp. palmirense with S. acaule. Solanum albicans is considered to be a hybrid of S. acaule and another species (Hawkes, 1990), and the AFLP distinction between subsp. palmirense and other populations of S. albicans may be due to another hybrid origin. While Kardolus’s (1998) placement of subsp. palmirense into S. acaule may be correct, we consider this issue unresolved from lack of sufficient comparative material. We synonymize subsp. palmirense with S. albicans here because of its morphological and ploidy affinities with that species. Kardolus and Groendijk-Wilders (1998) studied the inflorescence architecture of members of series Acaulia, series Demissa, and series Megistacroloba. They described five types of inflorescence architecture, including a type not recognized previously of a monochasium with an ""extra"" flower at its base in ser. Acaulia and S. demissum. None of these were species-specific and even varied on individual plants, but showed species-specific tendencies towards one type. Correll (1962), Hawkes (1990), and Ochoa (1999) placed S. albicans (hexaploid) in series Acaulia Juz., and related it to S. acaule (Ochoa) Ochoa, a tetraploid species distributed from Peru south to northern Argentina. Many studies have made it clear, however, that both S. acaule and S. albicans are also closely related to S. demissum Lindl., a hexaploid species from Mexico and Guatemala that Correll (1962) and Hawkes (1990) placed in the separate series Demissa Bukasov. The relationships of S. acaule, S. albicans, and S. demissum were shown by Bonierbale et al. (1990) and Debener et al. (1990) with single- to low-copy nuclear restriction fragment polymorphisms, by Spooner et al. (1995) and Kardolus (1999) with morphological data, by Kardolus (1998) and Jacobs et al. (2008) with AFLP data, and by Nakagawa and Hosaka (2002) with plastid and nuclear RFLPs. Based on these data Spooner et al. (2004) extracted S. demissum from its other North and Central American hexaploid relatives in series Demissa Bukasov, and classified S. acaule, S. albicans, and S. demissum in an informal Acaulia Group (Spooner et al., 1994). Solanum albicans is hexaploid, having an additional set of genomes (Matsubayashi 1991). A study by Hosaka and Spooner (1992) showed it to be clearly separated from the closely related S. acaule and S. ×aemulans as assessed by RFLP markers. Hawkes (1963) hypothesized S. albicans to be an amphiploid hybrid of S. acaule with a diploid wild species. Hybridization between S. acaule and other tetraploid species generally fails due to endosperm breakdown after fertilization (von Wangenheim 1954; Johnston and Hanneman 1980). The same Endosperm Balance Number (EBN) is assigned to those species giving normal seed set in their crosses regardless of their ploidy levels (Johnston et al. 1980). Most of the South American species are 2x (2EBN) and 4x (4EBN). However, subsp. albicans is 6x (4EBN), while other tetraploid subspecies of S. acaule are 4x (2EBN) (Johnston and Hanneman 1980). A mean chromosome pairing frequency of a trihaploid of subsp. albicans at metaphase I was 1.95 m + 9.67ii + 10.801 per cell (Matsubayashi and Ochoa, unpublished data), indicating that subsp. albicans is an allohexaploid with two similar genomes and a third genome that is distinct from the first two (Matsubayashi 1991). These data suggest that subsp. albicans is of amphiploid origin between tetraploid S. acaule and an unknown 2EBN diploid species having a distinct genome. The identity of this third genome is as yet undetected in a nuclear DNA study of allopolyploids of sect. Petota (Spooner et al., 2008). In the RFLP study of Hosaka and Spooner (1992), out of 49 S. albicans-specific bands, 44 were novel bands not found in the related species S. acaule or S. ×aemulans, most of which were possibly derived from the third genome. However, RFLPs of S. albicans were not accounted for by the simple addition of both subsp. acaule- or subsp. punae-common bands and the possible third genome-derived bands because five bands were commonly lost in subsp. albicans. Those bands characterizing subsp. albicans might have resulted from chromosome rearrangement after amphiploidization."
wfo-0001022216,"Lycianthes amatitlanensis is a widespread species with small white to pale yellow flowers (pubescent on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes and with tufted trichomes at the lobe tips) and long, coarse trichomes that spread away from the midvein on the abaxial side of the leaf (usually with some trichomes at an angle close to ninety degrees). Lycianthes amatitlanensis is morphologically similar and perhaps closely related to three other species occurring in Mexico and/or Central America: L. glabripetala E. Dean (endemic to Mexico); L. inconspicua Bitter (Central America); and L. inaequilatera (Rusby) Bitter (Costa Rica, Panama, and South America). Lycianthes inconspicua differs from L. amatitlanensis in having longer pedicels (15-30 mm in flower and 30-35 mm in fruit), appressed trichomes along the midvein of the abaxial side of the leaf, and ovate anthers with a shorter attenuate portion at the tip (ca. 0.25 mm long). Lycianthes inaequilatera has pedicels of similar length to those of L. amatitlanensis, but it has short, soft, appressed trichomes along the midvein on the abaxial side of the leaf. The Mexican species Lycianthes glabripetala has larger, nearly glabrous corollas and appressed, wavy trichomes along the midvein on the abaxial side of the leaf blade; L. glabripetala does not overlap in distribution with L. amatitlanensis. Where the distribution of L. amatitlanensis overlaps with L. inconspicua and L. inaequilatera, L. amatitlanensis tends to occur at lower elevations than the other two species. Intermediates between L. inaequilatera and L. amatitlanensis occur in Costa Rica and Panama, and these two species may eventually be treated as a single entity. Lycianthes inaequilatera is a South American species, originally described from Bolivia that has not been reported further north than Costa Rica. Lycianthes amatitlanensis is a Mexican and Central American species, originally described from Guatemala but reported in South America. Further study is needed to understand the ranges and variation of the two species. If united, L. inaequilatera is the earlier and correct name.

wfo-0001026651,"Solanum bradei is the most widely distributed and morphologically variable species of the Solanum inornatum species group. It is the only species of the group not necessarily associated with well-preserved sites, although always found in shaded environments, and is also the one that has the broadest elevational range. Despite the usual shrubby, robust habit of the species, specimens as small as 20-25 cm tall were found flowering, these mainly from the municipalities of Camanducaia and Gon&ccedil;alves, in southern Minas Gerais State. The species has distinctive geminate sympodia, with leaves differing in shape and size to a degree not observed in any other species of the group. Although this character was observed in all specimens in the field, some branches preserved on herbarium sheets do not retain well-developed minor leaves. Due to this, anisophylly was not used as a diagnostic character to separate the species, but it is certainly a useful character in the field. Some plants seem to develop diseased flowers, possibly the result of fungal or viral infection, as has been previously reported in other species of Solanum (see Hernández and Hennen 2003). In these cases an unusual form of calyx growth is observed where the expanded calyx covers the entire flower, making it resemble a fruit. This has resulted in misleading annotations on some labels [e.g. Polisel et al. 228 (SPSF) has Fruto imaturo verde written on the label but the specimen is actually flowering]. When dissected, the diseased flowers show an opened and lobed corolla, retained in the expanded calyx, and purplish blue anthers (in dried material) that produce less pollen than normal. These putatively infertile flowers are more common in young plants from disturbed areas. Solanum bradei can be easily distinguished from Solanum inornatum by its tiny deltate calyx lobes (1-2 mm long) that are not accrescent in fruit and its long-pedunculate inflorescence (peduncles up to 1 cm). Solanum inornatum has linear, 3-5 mm long calyx lobes and inflorescences with peduncles 1-4 mm long. The characters that separate it from the other species described in this paper are discussed further below, on each species discussion. In the past, sheets of Solanum bradei have been determined as Solanum apiahyense Witasek by various Solanum taxonomists, another poorly known species of uncertain affinities from secondary formations in São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina states. More recently, Solanum apiahyense was found to be closely related to Solanum trachytrichium Bitter, a species previously assigned to the Geminata clade (Knapp 2002b, L.L. Giacomin in prep.). Among species that could be confused with members of Solanum inornatum group and that are not considered part of the Brevantherum clade, these two (Solanum apiahyense and Solanum trachytrichium) are the only ones that we judge should be mentioned here. They can be distinguished from all species of the Solanum inornatum group by having inflorescences with fruiting peduncle longer than 1 cm and pedicels apically expanded with a constriction at the receptacle. The pubescence of the species are also distinctive: while Solanum apiahyense has very long, multicellular (up to 7 cells) unbranched trichomes, Solanum trachytrichium has unicellular trichomes that are hooked on a mound-like base, giving the leaves an scabrous aspect, rough to the touch (Knapp 2002b). The epithet honors the German botanist Alexander C. Brade [1881-1971] who greatly contributed to the growth of botany in Brazil in the middle 1900s. His efforts to better understand the flora of Itatiaia led to the earliest known collections of Solanum bradei.

wfo-0001028033,"Solanum friburgense is the only species of the Solanum inornatum group that has 2-foliate non-geminate sympodial units. It shares the linear-lanceolate calyx lobes with Solanum inornatum but can be distinguished from it by having the calyx lobes strongly recurved at anthesis, and the leaf pubescence concentrated along the veins and only sparsely present on the mesophyll of the leaf lamina, while Solanum inornatum has straight to slightly curved calyx lobes and trichomes evenly distributed on veins and mesophyll. The leaf shape is also a good character to separate the species: Solanum friburgense has elliptic leaves with attenuate bases and cuspidate apices and Solanum inornatum ovate leaves with rounded bases and attenuate apices. Solanum friburgense can be readily distinguished from Solanum bradei in its conspicuous linear-lanceolate calyx lobes versus tiny deltate calyx lobes of the former. As for all species of the Solanum inornatum group, Solanum friburgense has very discrete and almost hidden inflorescences, that are covered by the leaves if seen from above. This cryptic flowering could be the reason why the oldest known collection of the species is very recent, from the 1990s. The species has an intriguing reproductive system, apparently based mainly on vegetative propagation. Although two large populations were found at RPPN Bacchus, no flowering specimens were seen in three consecutive years of field work encompassing almost three months of the rainy season, when the two only flowering specimens were collected. No fruit was seen in the field or produced in cultivation, and we believe that the few known specimens are the result of a very restricted distribution and not a lack of collecting effort. Solanum friburgense inhabits the understory of primary cloud forest fragments, which are not uncommon in the mountain ranges surrounding Nova Friburgo, suggesting that its restricted distribution is due to its vegetative reproductive strategy and not habitat specificity. Future efforts should be made to locate this species at nearby reserves in Rio de Janeiro state such as Parque Estadual dos Três Picos, in Nova Friburgo and Parque Nacional da Serra dos Orgãos, in Teresópolis, in order to search for additional populations. The species is named after the municipality where all known collections are from, Nova Friburgo, in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

wfo-0001028883,"Solanum kriegeri is most similar to Solanum bradei; both have small, deltate calyx lobes (1-2 mm long). It is, however, a much smaller plant than Solanum bradei with glabrous or glabrescent leaves, with sparse trichomes normally restricted to the midrib and a sessile to subsessile inflorescence. Solanum kriegeri occasionally has geminate leaves, but not as frequently as in Solanum bradei and, when present, the minor leaves are very reduced and look like stipules. The fruits of Solanum kriegeri are also distinctive; they are larger than those of Solanum bradei (6-12 versus 4-7.8 mm) due to the seed size and number (6-12 versus 2-4 seeds per fruit respectively). Another good field character is the fruit aspect at maturity: dull green in Solanum kriegeri and shiny, and translucent (watery) in Solanum bradei. Besides the calyx morphology Solanum kriegeri can be readily distinguished from Solanum inornatum and Solanum friburgense by the glabrescent indument of its shiny chartaceous leaves, the only species of the group that presents such feature. Solanum kriegeri inhabits a very specific vegetation type and was thought to be endemic to Serra do Ibitipoca until recently when it was found in a neighboring mountain range. It is associated with dwarf cloud forests that grow as islands in highland grassy areas on sandy soils, normally within quartzite matrices. These formations are normally not as shaded as the habitats in which other species of the group are found, and although the soil is more well-drained, the atmospheric humidity is quite similar. It is common to find Solanum kriegeri growing in Sphagnum L. (Sphagnaceae) mats in these environments. The epithet honors the Father Leopoldo Krieger, a Brazilian naturalist and founder of the CESJ herbarium (Juiz de Fora, Brazil), one of the most important collections in Minas Gerais state.

wfo-0001031270,"Solanum sisymbriifolium is a distinctive species with its bright red, slightly sticky berries that are concealed within the accrescent calyx until ripe. The pinnatifid leaves are more deeply divided (usually, although less divided forms exist) than those of S. linnaeanum. Solanum linnaeanum also has larger, yellow berries and its dark purple flowers are heterostylous and the plant is strongly andromonoecious; S. sisymbriifolium has only a few short-styled flowers at the very distal tips of the inflorescences, and occasionally has pale violet flowers. The color forms account for many of the synonyms from plants in cultivation. In Madagascar, the unusual endemic S. mahoriense has deeply dissected leaves like those of S. sisymbriifolium, but is easily distinguished by its inflated calyx. Solanum sisymbriifolium is not yet known from Madagascar. Solanum sisymbriifolium is used as a trap crop for potato cyst nematodes (PCN) that cause massive damage to potato crops in northern Europe (Timmermans et al. 2007 a, b). The plants induce eggs of PCN to hatch but the standing crop is destroyed before the nematode is able to complete its life cycle. It was first introduced by scientists at Rothamsted Research in the United Kingdom, and has been shown to reduce infestations by 50-80%. In its native range, however, S. sisymbriifolium can be a serious weed of pastures, and attains high densities (like thistles in the northern hemisphere) due to its unpalatibility. In South Africa it has been classified as a noxious weed; it is likely that in the tropics and subtropics S. sisymbriifolium persists are a semi-perennial, while in the temperate zones it is an annual."
wfo-0001029625,"Solanum monarchostemon is sympatric with S. thelopodium over nearly its entire range, but does occur higher in the E Andean foothills than the latter. Label data indicate that where the two species do co-occur (i.e. Yasuni, Ecuador; Yanamono, Peru), S. monarchostemon occurs in upland, non-inundated forests, while S. thelopodium occurs in flooded forests. In areas where the two species grow together, intermediates do not appear to occur. To date (Knapp, 2000), no mixed collections of the two taxa have been seen, indicating their distinguishability to field collectors. More detailed demographic and population level studies on these species in areas of sympatry may shed additional light on these patterns."
wfo-0001027360,"Solanum cyanocarphium is a weakly climbing shrub to vine that scrambles over vegetation with hooked prickles; most specimens are quite thin-stemmed and somewhat scrappy. It is superficially similar to S. procumbens but differs from it in the strongly accrescent and spiny fruiting calyx (not accrescent in S. procumbens), larger prickles on stems and leaf blades, deeply lobed leaves (leaves usually entire in S. procumbens) and larger and many seeded berries. The accrescent calyx in fruit is similar to that of S. involucratum, but that species is more robust and has pubescent, rather than glabrous berries. Hul and Dy Phon (2014) suggested that S. cyanocarphium was introduced to Indochina but described what we recognise as a synonym (S. sakhanii) as new; we consider S. cyanocarphium to be native across tropical Asia where it occurs."
wfo-0001030548,"Solanum praetermissum is most similar to S. barbisetum, with which it is sympatric and has previously been confused. It was first described as a variety of the latter (as var. griffithii) and once it was recognised as distinct several attempts were made to assign a name at the specific level (see synonymy); none of these authors apparently realised the name S. praetermissum was already published and thus had priority. Both species are small shrubs and have small, whitish cream berries enclosed in prickly accrescent calyces. Solanum praetermissum can be distinguished from S. barbisetum in its pubescence of largely sessile stellate trichomes (versus long-stalked stellate trichomes), lack of bristles on the inflorescence (versus densely bristly inflorescences and calyces, especially in fruit), generally shorter inflorescence axes (1.5–3 cm versus 3–10 cm long, although some young inflorescences can be shorter), and smaller flowers (0.7–1.5 cm versus 1.8–2.2 cm in diameter)."
wfo-0001027471,"Solanum delicatulum was excluded from section Geminata (it was thought to be a member of section Solanum or a related group), and S. pavimenti included in the synonymy of Solanum pseudocapsicum by Knapp (2002). Subsequent studies by L. A. Mentz (Mentz & Oliveira, 2004) of this rare species have shown that it is a member of the section, and a member of the S. pseudocapsicum group with bright red fruit, and pedicels nodding in flower and erect in fruit. Some authors (G.E. Barboza, pers. comm.; Gutiérrez et al., 2006) distinguish S. pavimenti and S. delicatulum as distinct based on a suite of fruit and leaf characters that I feel are part of the overall variation in S. delicatulum. Studies by Gutiérrez et al. (2006) show that S. delicatulum is relatively widespread in Argentina and Brazil, and occurs sporadically in E Paraguay. It is a plant of understory in forests and along streams, and can be assessed as of Near Threatened (NT) or Vulnerable (VU), depending upon the circumscription of the species (as including S. pavimenti, as defined here or excluding it, as delimited by Gutiérrez et al., in press)."
wfo-0001028670,"Solanum inornatum is part of the Brevantherum clade of Solanum (Weese & Bohs 2007, Sarkinen et al 2013) and forms the Solanum inornatum species group, a well suported subclade of six species (Giacomin 2015). Solanum inornatum is similar to S. friburgense with which it shares a calyx of long linear lobes, which separate themo from all other species of the group. Solanum inornatum can be distinguished from S. friburgense by its 3-foliate sympodia versus 2-foliate in the last. Another good character to separate these species, as most of samples present a single inflorescence, is the shape and indumentum of the leaves. While the leaves of S. inornatum are ovate with rounded bases and attenuate apices, with trichomes evenly distributed along veins and mesophyll, S. friburgense has elliptic leaves with attenuate bases and cuspidate apices, and the trichomes are notably concentrated on veins and only sparsely present on the mesophyll. Although few specimens are known for the species, the studied collections show a considerable variation on the leaf morphology, as sessile to peciolate leaves were observed, some showing discretely raised veins (like the type collection) and others very prominent ones (e.g. Souza 950 [ESA]). "
wfo-0001029584,"Solanum minutifoliolum is similar to S. cajamarquense of Peru; both have ovate terminal leaflets and are densely pubescent. However, S. cajamarquense has white corollas whereas S. minutifoliolum has purple to blue corollas."
wfo-0001030782,"Solanum raquialatum is morphologically similar to S. olmosense. Both are robust species and possess leaves with a winged rachis and white corollas, although some populations of S. raquialatum have blue corollas. However, S. raquialatum has rotate corollas whereas S. olmosense has stellate corollas."
wfo-0001029112,"Solanum lobbianum is characterized by its short stature, densely pubescent leaves and calyx, terminal leaflet slightly larger than lateral leaflets, and secondary interjected leaflets present in terminal leaflet. Hawkes (1990) treated Solanum lobbianum as one of the species in Solanum sect. Petota series Tuberosa (Rydb.) Hawkes, but Ochoa (1992) placed the species in series Conicibaccata, a group containing diploids (2n = 24), tetraploids (2n = 48), and hexaploids (2n = 72). The polyploids are mainly distributed from southern Mexico south to central Peru (one species in northern Bolivia), and the diploids from northern Peru to central Bolivia. The species boundaries and relationships of members of series Conicibaccata have been studied using plastid DNA restriction sites (Castillo and Spooner, 1997), morphology (Castillo and Spooner, 1997; Fajardo et al., 2008), AFLPs (Jiménez et al., 2008), nuclear DNA (waxy) sequence data (Spooner et al., 2008), other nuclear DNA sequence data (Fajardo & Spooner 2011), and monographic studies (Hawkes, 1990; Hawkes and Hjerting, 1989; Ochoa, 1990, 1999). The plastid DNA restriction site and morphological data divide the diploids and polyploids into two clades or phenetic groups, respectively, but the morphological separation generally depends on the use of character states that sometimes overlap in range. The DNA sequence data show the polyploids to be of allopolyploid origin from the diploid members of the series and members of species outside of the series. A monographic study in progress by Fajardo and Spooner, using the above data, and herbarium specimens, will recognize only 17 species. All are very similar, united as a group by conical fruits, leaves with generally parallel-sided morphology, and narrowly ovate to elliptical leaflets. However, some unrelated species also have conical fruits, such as the Mexican diploid species S. hintonii Correll, S. lesteri Hawkes and Hjert. and S. trifidum Correll; the Mexican hexaploid species S. iopetalum (Bitter) Hawkes; and the Bolivian species S. stipulaceumBitter. An additional problem is that some species possess ovoid fruits that are not absolutely distinct from the conical fruits of the above species or the globose fruits more common in the majority of the members of sect. Petota.

wfo-0001031874,"Solanum tripartitum is a member of the Radicans clade, together with S. corymbosum, S. palitans and S. radicans. It is largely sympatric with and often is found growing with S. palitans in the same sort of weedy habitats. Both taxa have deeply lobed leaves with mostly three leaflets, although S. tripartitum occasionally has five leaflets. Poorly prepared herbarium specimens and those in young flowering condition can be difficult to identify; mixed collections are common. In the field the two species are distinct, with S. tripartitum being an upright plant, the base often decumbent but not rooting, and with erect and branched inflorescences and red ripe berries, while S. palitans is a prostrate plant, rooting at the nodes, and with the simple inflorescences holding the yellow-orange berries at the surface of the soil."
wfo-0001027881,"Solanum evolvuloides is similar to Solanum turneroides Chodatand they are the only species within the section presenting strong heterandry, with one stamen with a filament much longer than the other four. Sometimes Solanum parcistrigosum Bitterand Solanum hoffmannseggii Sendtner, species that also resemble Solanum evolvuloides, are weakly heterandrous but they both have smaller flowers (corolla with <1.5 cm in diameter) and stamens, and can be easily distinguished from Solanum evolvuloides by the glandular indument observed in the calyx and stems of the latter species. This character can be also used to separate Solanum evolvuloides from Solanum turneroides. These two speciesare also not sympatric, in Brazil Solanum turneroides is found only in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo, whereas Solanum evolvuloides occurs only in Bahia. Solanum turneroides has an indument composed of unbranched eglandular hairs mainly with one-celled appressed hairs on the calyces, leaves and stems, associated with two-celled hairs that are typically geniculate (bent at a 90 angle) between the first and second cell. It is also a more robust shrub with chartaceous leaves, in contrast to the more membranaceous leaves of Solanum evolvuloides. Within the section, glandular hairs are commonly found on the leaves of Solanum adscendens Sendtner but in this species, the hairs are much smaller (up to 0.1 mm, barely visible in dried material) than those of Solanum evolvuloides, have glands composed of more than one cell, and are associated with several erect eglandular hairs. The hairs of Solanum evolvuloides, perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of the species, are up to 0.5 mm long, are stalked, have unicellular glands, and are not commonly found on the leaves. The heterandry found in Solanum evolvuloides is not a common feature within Solanum, and its evolution had been focus of recent studies, using morphological or molecular data (Lester et al. 1999, Bohs et al. 2007). Both cited works conclude that this character evolved several times independently within the genus. Within the Brevantherum clade (sensu Weese and Bohs 2007), only the two species of sect. Gonatotrichum cited above are known to be strongly heterandrous. The species do not present strong enantiostyly, but in both cases a deflection on the style apex is observed (see Fig. 2A), that might function to receive pollen from a bee's abdomen, as pointed out in other studies of heterandrous and enantiostylous Solanum species (e.g. Vallejo-Marín 2009).

wfo-0001029988,"The many Central American and northern South American collections of section Micracantha have often been placed under the name S. lanceifolium Jacquin; but in the floras of Veracruz, Mexico (Nee, 1993), and the Venezuelan Guayana, these collections have been divided into four closely related species: S. laicet- folium, S. adhaerens Roemer & Schultes,   S. aturense Dunal, and S. tampicense Dunal. There are several additional ill-defined species closely related to them in the Amazonian region. Solanum nuricum differs from the core ot the “Solarium lanceifolium group” by having unifoliate rather than difoliate, geminate sympodia, i.e., leaves single rather than geminate at a node, and a to- mentose fruit. It most closely resembles S. rupincola Sendtner of Bahia and Espirito Santo in eastern Brazil, from which it differs by thinner, non-revolute-margined leaves, smaller fruits, and wider calyx lobes. "
wfo-0001032264,"Solanum vacciniiflorum is easily recognized by its large pointed buds, bullate leaves, and weak, reddish pubescence of the leaf undersides. It is most closely related to S. validinervium of montane western Venezuela but differs from that species in its leaf shape, geminate leaf clusters, and pointed flower buds. Solanum vacciniiflorum is one of the largest of the Central American members of section Geminata, growing to 25 m tall in sheltered areas. Collections of the species from Panama have much longer inflorescences than those from Costa Rica but are otherwise identical to Costa Rican plants. Trichomes in S. vacciniiflorum are polymorphic in being uniseriate simple or branched, but whether branched or simple, they are small-celled and weak. The occurrence of branched trichomes on the leaf undersides is sporadic in the species; some individuals have many of the trichomes branched, while others have all uniseriate trichomes. Those individuals with more branched hairs are not from more exposed habitats, so it seems the character is not under environmental control."
wfo-0001026736,"Solanum caesium is distinctive and not easily confused with any other morelloid in South America. The fleshy, almost succulent leaves that are usually glabrous, lax forked inflorescences with spaced flowers and reflexed pedicels that develop a distinct kink at the base in fruit, long-triangular calyx lobes that enclose the yellowish orange berry like a cage and the rotate corolla are all found in combination only in S. caesium. The fleshy leaves are similar to those of some populations of S. pentlandii, but that is a species of high elevations in Peru and Bolivia and has much smaller stellate flowers that are usually violet."
wfo-0001028281,"Solanum habrochaites is part of a basal polytomy in the tomatoes, or in some analyses done with DNA sequence data is a member of a clade containing S. chilense, S. peruvianum, S. huaylasense and S. corneliomulleri. It is morphologically very easy to distinguish from all other wild tomato. The sterile apical appendage of the anthers is extremely long and thin, and the broadly rotate, shallowly lobed golden yellow corollas are distinctive. Pubescence in S. habrochaites is quite variable and Müller’s (1940a) forma glabratum consists of plants that are not strictly glabrous, but only have a less dense covering of the longest trichomes on all parts. The characteristic strong aroma of S. habrochaites is caused by secretions from glandular trichoem with a 4-celled head. Solanum habrochaites grows in high elevations in the northern range of sect. Lycopersicon; only S. pimpinellifolium is found as far north; S. habrochaites also can be found in coastal lomas habitats in northern Peru. Some plants (e.g. Rubio et al. 1768 from southern coastal Ecuador) that are smaller than more typical specimens of S. habrochaites can be confused with S. corneliomulleri, but the straight anther tube with a long, narrow “beak” and largely non-glandular pubescence aid identification. These smaller flowered plants are likely to be self-compatible, as small-flowers are correlated with self-compatibility in other species (Georgiady & Lord 2002). The breeding system of S. habrochaites is self-incompatible allogamous, with some self-compatible populations (probably those with smaller flowers) at the margin of the distribution (Rick et al. 1979). One TGRC accession of S. habrochaites (LA1777) have been used by Steve Tanksley's group (Cornell University) to produce backcross recombinant inbred lines with the S. lycopersicum cultivar E-6203 (LA4024). The 99 IL lines contains introgressed segment of S. habrochaites that covers giving coverage of approximately 85% of the genome. These lines have been important to produce genetic maps, and to explore resistance to insects, and yield and quality."
wfo-0001025817,"Solanum albidum is closely related to S. whalenii, an endemic species from Bolivia. Solanum whalenii differs mainly by being more robust in all aspects, and more restricted altitudinally and ecologically at 1800-3000 m and more confined to humid forests, whereas S. albidum is often found in more open, weedier, and drier habitats over a much greater altitudinal range. The only other species of sect. Torva in the New World with such strongly bicolorous leaves are S. hayesii of Colombia to Nicaragua, and S. paniculatum of eastern Brazil; both differ in a number of characters. Solanum hayesii has much smaller flowers. Solanum paniculatum is a less robust plant in all respects and highly disjunct to eastern Brazil, northeastern Argentina and Paraguay. Solanum albidum is sympatric with a number of other species of sect. Torva, but the only putative hybrid that has been noted was from near Montero, Prov. Santiesteban, Depto. Santa Cruz, at an altitude of 295 m, where a plant intermediate between S. albidum and the common S. acutilobum Dunal was found in an area where both species are present (Nee 33441). Solanum acutilobum is distributed in the plains from Santa Cruz city through northern Bolivia and sparingly into adjacent Brazil and Peru; it differs in many characters, significantly by the small bright orange berries. At one time Nee thought that the variety Solanum paniculatum var. chulumani should be recognized and transferred to S. albidum, but although the difference in pubescence of the veins of the underside of the leaf is very visible and the distribution of these specimens is geographically quite distinct (southernmost Peru and Bolivia), these differences now seem too trivial to recognize taxonomically. Field observations in Bolivia seem to indicate that this species is clonal, forming colonies from root sprouts. This character needs to be investigated in this and other species of Solanum sect. Torva."
wfo-0001028791,"Solanum juglandifolium is most closely related to S. ochranthum, and can be easily distinguished from that species by its much rougher leaves that are not markedly paler beneath, less numerous interjected leaflets, and stellate corollas with long-acuminate calyx lobes. The extremely rough upper leaf surfaces of S. juglandifolium are distinctive. This roughness is the result of trichome-topped protuberances on the adaxial surface and feels like sandpaper to the touch in both live plants and herbarium specimens. Although S. ochranthum occasionally has slightly rough leaf surfaces, the trichome bases are never as large and developed as in S. juglandifolium, and never appear as distinct protuberances under the microscope Correll (1962) in his key of the two taxa, reversed the number of interstitial leaflets character, indicating that S. juglandifolium have leaves usually with various sized interstitial leaflets and S. ochranthum leaves without or with very few small orbicular interstitial leaflets. In fact, S. juglandifolium has fewer leaflets than does S. ochranthum, in addition to fewer interjected interstitial leaflets, although some specimens can be difficult to determine in the absence of flowers or fruit. This reversal of the leaf characters has led to considerable confusion in herbarium determinations made using Correll’s key. In S. juglandifolium pseudostipules are poorly developed, deciduous, and usually absent, while in S. ochranthum pseudostipules are usually present and well developed in all nodes. Several varieties of S. juglandifolium have been described mainly based on leaflet size, differences in pubescence, and roughness of the lamina. We do not consider these infraspecific variations to be taxonomically significant, as they are not consistent with habitat preference or geographical distribution along the distributional range of S. juglandifolium."
wfo-0001032209,"Solanum uncinellum is the oldest name for the species that has variably been called either S. pensile or S. ipomoea, depending upon the type of pubescence (see below). The provenance of the plant grown in the Horticultural Society’s garden in Chiswick (London, England) was not known to Lindley, but from the fact that it was grown outdoors in England it is likely to have been from the southern part of the species range. The lack of branched pubescence may be due to the wet conditions under which it would have been grown in England. The holotype in the Lindley herbarium at CGE is labelled “HHS July 1837” and “S. uncinellum, Bot. Reg. 1840 t. 15” in Lindley’s hand. Solanum uncinellum is a very widespread and variable species, occurring in a huge range of habitats throughout the American tropics. The extremes of pubescence variation in S. uncinellum look very different, but an entire range of intermediates occur scattered throughout the region; no consistent geographic patterns can be discerned. Even within a single collection (e.g., duplicates of Schomburgk 594), almost glabrous and densely pubescent sheets can be seen. Plants from the southern part of the range (the Chaco of Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina) are more consistently pubescent with dendritic trichomes and often have cordate leaf bases, and those from western Ecuador have almost completely glabrous leaves. Specimens from the Amazon and Guianas, however, are mostly dendritic pubescent with elliptic leaves or have a mixture of dendritic and simple trichomes of varying densities. Pubescence density and type may depend upon the microclimate or exposure status of the plant or part of plant, as has been observed in other species (e.g., S. confertiseriatum, see Knapp, 2002). Flower morphology is remarkably consistent throughout the range of the species, although flower size varies from plant to plant. Juvenile leaves of S. uncinellum are not known, but are likely to be pinnate or deeply pinnatifid. A series of sterile specimens from tropical America variously identified as “Solanum dulcamara” (MacBride, 1962) are probably juvenile specimens of S. uncinellum. Some specimens (Rimachi 8110) from the Iquitos area of Peru are densely pubescent like those from the southern portion of the species range, and have pinnate leaves on reproductive stems. Associating juvenile foliage with adult plants of S. uncinellum will be difficult, but would be useful in determining if, like many other members of the clade (e.g., see S. dulcmaroides), this species has pinnate pre-reproductive leaf morphology. Solanum uncinellum is not easily confused with any other Neotropical Solanum species; the elongate flower buds with an apical nipple, narrowly stellate corollas and large complex inflorescences are all distinctive. In fruit it could be confused with other members of the Dulcamaroid clade, but short petioles and “hairy” seeds distinguish it from any other South American species. “Hairy” seeds also occur in S. dulcamaroides and S. seaforthianum, but those taxa differ from S. uncinellum in flower shape (neither of them are deeply stellate with narrow corolla lobes) and morphology (only S. seaforthianum has unequal filaments, but not as pronounced as in S. uncinellum) and in leaf characters. The leaves of S. seaforthianum are glabrous and pinnate, while those of S. uncinellum are usually variously pubescent; the leaves of S. dulcamaroides have a promounced submarginal vein. Solanum flaccidum, with which S. uncinellum is sympatric in the southeastern part of its range, also has anthers borne on unequal filaments, but in that species the anthers are ellipsoid, not tapering, and the long filament is less than twice the length of the rest of the filaments, whereas in S. uncinellum the long filament is approximately two times the length of the rest. The corollas of S. flaccidum are also more rotate than those of S. uncinellum, with broader lobes. From specimen labels it appears that S. uncinellum has red, purple or metallic blue berries when ripe. Fruiting collections with ripe berries are not especially common, and these color differences do not appear to have a geographic component. It may be that berry color changes through development, as has been observed in other species such as S. nitidum (also of the Dulcamaroid clade; see Knapp, 1989). "
wfo-0001030032,"Solanum ochranthum is most closely related to S. juglandifolium, and can be easily distinguished from the latter by the markedly paler undersurfaces of the leaves, the more numerous interjected leaflets and the rotate, usually more golden yellow corollas and acute calyx lobes. The paler color of the undersurfaces is partly due to the dense pubescence but also due to a paler lamina. Some specimens of S. ochranthum have somewhat rough adaxial leaf surfaces, but they never as rough as S. juglandifolium. Close examination with a dissecting microscope should allow the two taxa to be easily distinguished. For a discussion of the equivocal nature of the key in Correll (1962), see S. juglandifolium. Solanum ochranthum occurs at slightly higher elevations than does S. juglandifolium, particularly where the two taxa are sympatric. Solanum ochranthum has large fruits (to more than 5 cm in diameter, see Fig. 6H in Smith & Peralta 2002) with markedly woody walls at maturity, a character state unusual in Solanum in general, although S. abitaguense and S. cucullatum of section Geminata and S. lycocarpon (a spiny Solanum from the cerrados of southern South America) also have very large fruits (Knapp 2002a). The many varieties of S. ochranthum described by Bitter reflect the variability in leaf size and number of leaflets in the species, and the variability in pubescence throughout the range. Some populations are more pubescent than others, but the difference is only one of degree and the character varies randomly throughout the distributional range of S. ochranthum."
wfo-0001027920,"Solanum felinum is closely related to S. vestissimum, but its striking hirsute vestiture and other characters make it easy to distinguish from that species in the region of sympatry in northern Venezuela. The bristly vestiture of S. felinum is nearly duplicated in some forms of S. vestissimum from Colombia. Contrasting floral and fruit characters of the two species are illustrated in Figure 20 of Whalen et al. (1981) with material from adjacent plants in a cloud forest near Colonia Tovar. Flowers of S. felinum are large and white and the calyx green; fruits are narrowly obovoid and contain dark-colored seeds. Solanum vestissimum here has small lavender flowers, petaloid calyces, more broadlly ellipsoid berries, and somewhat lighter colored seeds. Floral characters in S. vestissimum are quite variable, however, and in western Venezuela and Colombia, forms with larger, white flowers are frequently encountered. The most reliable characters separating S. felinum and S. vesitssimum are those of foliar vestiture. In S. felinum, adaxial leaf surfaces bear two strikingly different types of stellae, both sessile: one type with elongate midpoints that are responsible for the hirsute appearance of the leaf above and another minute form with very short midpoints and lateral rays. Stellae of upper leaf surfaces in S. vestissimum vary considerably in size but are not resolvable into two clearly distinct size classes. In addition, stalked stellae are often found scattered on adaxial surfaces of S. vestissimum leaves.
"
wfo-0001032362,"The most striking variation in S. vestissimum is in vestiture and in corolla color and size. At the eastern extreme of its range in Aragua and Distrito Federal, Venezuela, the species consistently displays a dense granular-felty pubescence on vegetative parts, composed of small stellae with relatively short stalks, midpoints and rays. As one travels westward along the Venezuelan Cordillera and into Colombia, the indument becomes far more variable, and a high proportion of collections have larger stellae, more bristly in character, with elongate stalks and relatively long midpoints and rays. In the east, corollas are consistently lavender and small for the species, while further west, flowers are often larger, and white morphs become common. Although fruits of S. vestissimum are large and have excellent flavor, they are difficult to eat or use in beverages. They are armed with a dense and persistent covering of stiff, sharp bristles, the elongate midpoints of the exocarp stellae. These bristles break off and become lodged in the fingers when the fruits are handled. It is difficult to imagine that they do no deter certain frugivores in the wild, as well. At full ripeness, fruits of S vestissimum are often observed to swell and burst, rupturing the pericarp and exposing the bright orange flesh and seeds. It may be at this stage that the fruits become attractive to frugivores and potential dispersal agents. Armed fruits that burst at maturity may benefit the plants by discouraging early taking of fruits before seeds are fully developed."
wfo-0001031372,"We were able to locate only one collection of S. stagnale in major American herbaria, so the species is not well known to us. We hope that a search for it in the wild in Bahia and in Brazilian herbaria will eventually turn up more material. Living collections are especially needed. Essentially nothing is known of the properties of the fruit or of other characteristics that may be of value in breeding programs. We are not aware of any collections made more recently than the middle nineteenth century, and the region from which these came is now densely populated. It is important that the current status of S. stagnale in the wild be investigated and that living material be brought into cultivation. Solanum stagnale is phylogenetically isolated in section Lasiocarpa. Some anomalous characters of the species are the reddish pubescence, decurrent leaf blades with stipitate stellae on adaxial surfaces, and the well-developed lateral rays of pericarp stellae. Although S. stagnale is distant from the other species, there is little justification for its exclusion from section Lasiocarpa. It shares all the synapomorphic characters that define the section, except reduced lateral rays on fruit trichomes. Commentary of Bohs (2005): Molecular data clearly place S. stagnale outside of sect. Lasiocarpa. Furthermore, they ally it with S. accrescens, a member of S. sect. Erythrotrichum. Solanum sect. Erythrotrichum is notable for its ferruginous pubescence and, often, decurrent leaf bases. Based on molecular and, in hindsight, morphological data, it is almost certain that S. stagnale should be considered a member of S. sect. Erythrotrichum."
wfo-0001028513,"Solanum hyporhodium is related to S. vestissimum and the two have often been confused. Solanum hyporhodium is most readily distinguished by the cauline stellae with short midpoints and the globose or subglobose fruits with partially deciduous trichomes. The calyx is often distinctive, as well. In most forms of S. hyporhodium, the calyx lobes are short and rounded or apiculate, and the corolla is exposed early in bud. The calyx is larger in S. vestissimum and nearly covers the bud until shortly before anthesis. A few collections of S. hyporhodium do have rather large calyx lobes; Steyermark & Steyermark 95333 from Carabobo is especially extreme in this respect. Vestiture of upper leaf surfaces also provides characters that effectively separate S. hyporhodium and S. vestissimum. The upper leaf surfaces of S. hyporhodium are pubescent with sessile stellate hairs with midpoints 0.2-0.8 mm long, whereas those of S. vestissimum have both sessile and stalked stellaewith midpoints 0.3-2 mm long.
"
wfo-0001028269,"Solanum guineense is a distinctive species, with sessile inflorescences bearing only a few flowers with campanulate to spreading corolla lobes, fleshy leaves and bright orange fleshy berries (Fig. 7). The only other species with which it could be confused is the sympatric and vegetatively somewhat similar S. africanum, with branched inflorescences with more, smaller flowers and blackish purple berries. Solanum africanum has a winged stem and rhomboid leaves, while S. guineense has a rounded stem and oblanceolate or obovoid leaves. Solanum guineense was long known by the later name S. aggregatum; it was only in the 1950s that the correct name for this South African taxon began to be used (Heine 1960). The name S. guineense (L.) Mill. is still occasionally used for the Morelloid clade species correctly called S. scabrum Mill., the Garden Huckleberry (Edmonds 2012), and is based on the basionym S. nigrum var. guineense L."
wfo-0001032274,"Leaf shape in Solanum valdiviense is incredibly variable, and ranges from lanceolate and sometimes basally lobed on non-reproductive (and some reproductive) shoots, to minute and almost orbicular or elliptic on reproductive shoots. Long sucker shoots invariably have lanceolate leaves, but reproductive shoots may have either type. Leaves of juvenile shoots are sometimes lobed at the base. This variability has led to the relatively many synonyms for this species of quite restricted range; for example, R.A. Philippi described S. puberulum on the basis of its leaf shape and pubescence. Specimens identified as S. krauseanum are particularly weak and thin specimens, and the leaves are membranous and more ovate than is usual. The stems, however, have the characteristic wings and pubescence of S. valdiviense. The inflorescence in S. valdiviense is borne terminally on short axillary shoots (occasionally leaf opposed or the shoot much reduced), a character shared with the otherwise very different S. inodorum of southeastern Brazil. In many specimens, the leaves of the short shoots are smaller and more congested than those of the main stems, but not always. Rarely does the short shoot lack well-developed leaves; this leads to the plant having a bushy appearance. Pubescence is also quite variable in S. valdiviense, varying from nearly absent to dense. This variation does not seem to have an ecological basis, and is quite common in the Dulcamaroid clade in general. Flower color in S. valdiviense also varies from white to purple, again a common characteristic in the Dulcamaroid clade. The strongly reflexed petals are mentioned often on labels, and appear to be characteristic of S. valdiviense. Solanum valdiviense could be confused with another species of the Dulcamaroid clade occurring in coastal Chile, S. alphonsei. Solanum alphonsei has consistently lobed leaves that are more deltoid in outline, open, many-branched inflorescences and is usually a vine, rather than a lax shrub."
wfo-0001027128,"Solanum cochabambense is one of the most variable and widespread morelloid species in South America. Barboza et al. (2013) placed S. cochabambense in synonymy with S. aloysiifolium, with which it is sympatric in northern Argentina. Further study throughout the range of S. cochabambense confirmed the distinctness of the two species, but individual specimens collected in sympatry can be difficult to identify. Solanum cochabambense differs from S. aloysiifolium in its more highly branched inflorescences (those of S. aloysiifolium are usually only forked), buds that are ellipsoid rather than narrowly ellipsoid and larger corollas and berries. The anthers of S. aloysiifolium are narrow relative to their length (3.9–5 mm long and 0.6–1 mm wide in S. aloysiifolium versus 3.5–4 mm long and 0.9–1.2 mm wide in S. cochabambense) but this character can be difficult to see in the absence of comparative material. The berries of S. cochabambense are larger (1–1.2 cm in diameter) than those of S. aloysiifolium (0.5–0.6 cm in diameter), with similar numbers of stone cells. In Bolivia S. cochabambense is partially sympatric with and morphologically very similar to S. pallidum. Solanum pallidum differs in its possession of dendritic trichomes, while S. cochabambense has only simple trichomes. In the northern part of its range, S. cochabambense can be confused with S. arequipense, S. juninense and S. interandinum. Solanum juninense differs in its possession of glandular trichomes whereas S. cochabambense is always eglandular. Solanum arequipense has blunt-tipped calyx lobes, anthers 2.5–3 mm long and a strongly capitate stigma, while S. cochabambense has long-triangular calyx lobes with acute apices, anthers 3.5–4 mm long and a clavate to only somewhat capitate stigma. The calyx lobes of S. interandinum are longer and more pointed than those of S. cochabambense, and the flowers are smaller (0.8–1.4(1.8) cm in diameter versus 2–3 cm in diameter in S. cochabambense)."
wfo-0001030921,"As delimited here Solanum rubiginosum is a distinctive species, easily recognised by its liana (woody vine) habit, appearing erect and shrub-like when young (i.e., von Rohr s.n., the type specimen), adpressed, reddish pubescence and elliptic, coriaceous, discolorous leaves with revolute margins and lustrous, rugose adaxial surfaces. The inflorescences are strictly terminal, the flowers to 3.5 cm in diameter and the fruits reddish with stellate trichomes. Solanum rubiginosum resembles to S. decorum, with which it shares leaf shape, the color of indument and inflorescence type. It differs from that species in its habit, coriaceous leaves with revolute margins and sessile porrect-stellate trichomes, more open inflorescences, larger flowers with purple to deep violet corolla, stellate-pubescent fruits and smaller seeds. Two specimens of S. rubiginosum were found in the Vahl herbarium in Copenhagen. Of these, C-22914 (F neg. 22914) exactly matches the illustration in Vahl (1798) and is clearly the holotype of this species."
wfo-0001028481,"Solanum humblotii is a forest liana with minute dendritic pubescence, triangular to long-triangular calyx lobes and thickly chartaceous discolorous leaves with an apiculate tip. The name S. humblotii has been mistakenly applied S. truncicola following the synonymy established by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994), and to S. madagascariense though misidentification. The vegetative morphology of Solanum humblotii is very similar to some populations of the widespread S. madagascariense. The two species can be distinguished easily on inflorescence size and calyx morphology. The inflorescence of S. humblotii has only 2-3 (exceptionally 4) flowers on long filiform pedicels and is never branched, while that of S. madagascariense is many times branched with many flowers except on some aberrant specimens; calyx lobes are 3-4.5 mm long in S. humblotii, and up to 1 mm long in S. madagascariense. Specimens recognised by Knapp and Vortonsova (2016) as Solanum truncicola were treated as S. humblotii by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994), where the two were treated as synonyms. The two species are similar, and prior to our study S. humblotii was only known from the type collection. Further collecting in the wet forests of northern Madagascar has resulted in more specimens with which to assess the status of these two taxa (see also discussion under S. truncicola). Solanum humblotii differs from S. truncicola by its petioles that are 6-10 mm (versus 1-5 mm) long, acuminate (versus acute) leaves, pubescent (versus glabrous) young stems, and inflorescences with a peduncle up to 5 mm long (versus no peduncle). The calyx of S. humblotii is fused in bud (Fig. 9); the tube is longer than the lobes and tears for up to 2 mm at anthesis with corolla expansion. The resulting calyx lobes are 3-4.5 mm long, triangular to narrowly triangular and acuminate, chartaceous, and sparsely covered in fine dendritic (almost scurfy) pubescence. This calyx morphology is similar to that of S. imamense, S. betroka and S. sambiranense. The calyx of S. truncicola is unlike that of any other Madagascar Solanum. It is dissected almost to the base in bud and does not tear by more than 1 mm at anthesis; the calyx lobes are linear to narrowly ovate or obovate, membranous, and usually glabrous. Solanum humblotii is restricted to a small area of wet forest in the eastern ecoregion of Madagascar (Humbert 1955; Faramalala 1988, 1995), a habitat like that of the related wet forest climbing species S. madagascariense and S. trichopetiolatum. It is sympatric with the morphologically similar S. madagascariense and occurs considerably further south of S. trichopetiolatum; the distribution range of the epiphyte S. truncicola lies directly to the south of S. humblotii with some overlap in distribution ranges around the Moramanga area.The locality of the type collection within Madagascar is not known, but is likely to be from the region where all other specimens of S. humblotii have been collected. Dammer (1906) describes it as a shrub but the type specimens contain no such information; modern collections record a variety of growth forms (shrub, liana and epiphyte) in both primary and secondary habitats. 
"
wfo-0001029286,"Solanum macrothyrsum is a rare liana endemic to Mayotte. It has large bright inflorescences of 15-50 white or violet flowers, large, membranous leaves on long petioles, a very small calyx (less than 1/8 of the corolla length at anthesis) and noticeably short, plump anthers (2.5-3 x 1.5-2 mm) on comparatively long filaments (1-1.5 mm). Solanum macrothyrsum is unusual in the group in having little pubescence on its vegetative parts, except some isolated trichomes on abaxial side of the midvein forming tufts in the vein axils (domatia) (see Fig. 15). The four duplicates of the type collection show considerable variation in leaf size, leaf thickness and venation; this perhaps represents leaves growing in the sun and in the shade or the type could have been gathered from several plants. Since its original description by Dammer (1906), S. macrothyrsum been been known only from the type collection. It was rediscovered on the main island of Mayotte, Maore, in 2001 (Barthelat & Ali Sifari 559). There are no species of Solanum on Mayotte similar to S. macrothyrsum. The species that most resembles S. macrothyrsum is S. ivohibe from eastern Madagascar: they share long petioles, decurrent leaf bases and branched inflorescences with a long peduncle. The two taxa are clearly distinct. Solanum macrothyrsum has anthers 2.5-3 mm (versus 3.5-4 mm) long, inflorescences branching 2-3 times (versus branching once), 15-50 (versus 10-16) flowers per inflorescence, peduncle 4.5-7 cm (versus 2-2.7 cm) long, and calyx lobes up to 0.5 mm long (versus 0.8-2 mm long). Solanum madagascariense is the only species with short anthers and open, lax inflorescences like S. macrothyrsum. Solanum macrothyrsum differs from S. madagascariense in its membranous (versus thick chartaceous to coriaceous) leaves, smaller leaf length to width ratio, petiole 1.5-4 cm (versus 0.4-2 cm) long, and smaller calyx, less than 1/8 (versus 1/6-1/3) of corolla length at anthesis. Edmonds (2012), following the suggestion of R.N. Lester (pers. comm.) and Jaeger (1985) suggested that S. macrothyrsum was synonymous with S. benderianum (here treated as a synonym of S. runsoriense) from Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya. Bitter (1917) also placed S. macrothyrsum as a relative of the S. terminale alliance (his section Afrosolanum) rather than with the Madagascar endemic species. There are numerous differences between these taxa: the calyx lobes of S. macrothyrsum are less than 0.5 mm long while the calyx lobes of S. benderianum are 2-4 mm long; the petioles of S. macrothyrsum are often longer than &frac12; of the leaf length while the petioles of S. runsoriense are less than 1/3 of the leaf length. In addition, the anthers of S. runsoriense have pores that elongate to lateral slits following dehiscence, while S. macrothyrsum, like the Malagasy members of this group, has anthers with distinct pores that never elongate. Solanum terminale also occurs in the Comoro Islands, but is known there from only three collections (syntypes of S. comorense Dammer, Schmidt 263 and 284 [both presumably destroyed in Berlin] and a later gathering Humblot 1284, the neotype of S. comorense). There are no recent collections, and it is possible these represent mislabelling of collections from continental Africa. Solanum macrothyrsum differs from S. terminale in its anthers that never become longitudinally dehiscent, its more openly branched inflorescences with widely spaced flowers, and its tufts of trichomes in the axils of the main leaf veins on the abaxial surfaces."
wfo-0001029731,"Solanum myrsinoides is a distinctive wet forest endemic. Its large coriaceous or fleshy leaves, often epiphytic habit and apically elongated fruit are unusual in Solanum. Solanum myrsinoides seems to grow as a liana but can lose connection with the ground and survive as an epiphyte as high as 4 m in the canopy. The stems of S. myrsinoides are often winged. The thick petioles are flexuous and have a wrinkled woody texture when dry; it seems likely that these are used for climbing. Size and shape of the leaves is highly variable between collections and probably therefore plants. The peduncle and rachis are long and slender, in contrast to the thick stems. It is the only Solanum species in Madagascar that is completely glabrous on all vegetative parts, with nothing but small papillae on the apices of the calyx and corolla lobes. D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) report that these trichomes are sometimes branched, but we have not seen this in any of the specimens we have examined. Solanum myrsinoides is unlikely to be confused with another species of Solanum. Some large leaved individuals of S. truncicola are highly reminiscent of S. myrsinoides in their leaves and habit, perhaps reflecting common adaptation to montane wet forest understorey. Solanum myrsinoides can be distinguished by its calyx lobes that are less than 1 mm long (versus 4-11 mm long), inflorescences with 2-6 flowers (versus 1-2 flowers), and distinct slender peduncle 4-9 cm long (versus peduncle absent). The distribution of the two species does not overlap; S. myrsinoides occurs at lower elevations further north. The developing fruit of S. myrsinoides has a globose basal part and a clearly distinct elongated apical beak that gradually tapers to a point (Fig. 19). At maturity the basal globose part narrows to produce a woody (in dry specimens) ovoid shape; sometimes the basal part of the fruit also narrows so the berry is fusiform (spindle-shaped) and tapers at both ends. Among the non-spiny Solanum species endemic to Madagascar, similar apically pointed fruits occur in S. betroka, S. imamense, S. sambiranense, and S. truncicola; globose berries have been observed in S. imamense, S. madagascariense, and S. trichopetiolatum. The thick, possibly spongy flesh seen in S. myrsinoides is not apparent in other Madagascar solanums, but these species are rarely collected in fruit; further field observations are necessary."
wfo-0001029289,"Solanum madagascariense is a liana with prominent terminal inflorescences of 15-45 white to deep purple flowers (Fig. 1C in Knapp and Vortonsova 2016), sturdy branches, and thick leaves. It occurs throughout Madagascar's wet forests which are situated predominantly on the eastern coast, adjacent parts of the High Plateau, and northern parts of the island. It is the most common and variable species of endemic non-spiny Solanum. Solanum madagascariense is similar and possibly closely related to the rare and local species S. trichopetiolatum and S. humblotii. It can be distinguished from S. trichopetiolatum by its glabrous petioles (versus petioles with long simple trichomes 0.5-0.15 mm long); S. trichopetiolatum also has looser inflorescences with finer branches and fewer flowers, a greater tendency towards discolorous oblong leaves and is restricted to a narrow area of Antsiranana. Solanum madagascariense differs from S. humblotii in its large, many-branched inflorescence with many flowers; S. humblotii has an unbranched inflorescence with few flowers and is restricted to the northern part of Madagascar in Toamasina. Solanum madagascariense as delimited here encompasses great range of variation. It is possible to isolate groups of specimens with small long narrow leaves, groups of specimens with wide coriaceous leaves and fewer veins, and groups of specimens with sparse inflorescences and hariy leaves, but intermedidates between all these forms are common. The name S. apocynifolium has been used to describe individuals with tomentose stems and smaller leaves. Variation in indumentum is continuous with that observed in other populations of S. madagascariense, and leaf size seems to be largely determined by ecological factors. Solanum apocynifolium was accepted by Bitter (1917), tentatively accepted by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) with acknowledgement of continuous variation, and accepted at the level of variety by the late R.N. Lester (unpublished manuscript). Forms recognised as the two taxa are the extremes of a range of morphological variation and are here considered to be conspecific. Solanum nitens is a smaller glabrous variant of S. madagascariense with shiny subcoriaceous leaves and a shrubby, densely branched growth form that grows in drier, more central areas of Madagascar. It was accepted by Bitter (1917), reduced to a variety by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) and considered a synonym of S. madagascariense by Lester (unpublished manuscript). We agree with Richard Lester's assessment and S. nitens is included in S. madagascariense as an arid environment variant. Solanum antalaha is a wet environment variant of S. madagascariense occurring further north, representing mature or shade dwelling individuals. Solanum antalaha has glabrous leaves, petioles, stems, and corolla, and leaves with fewer veins; it was described as having larger anthers but these are less than 3.8 mm long on the type specimen, within the variation range of S. madagascariense (2.5-4 mm long). Solanum marojejy was described as a Marojejy endemic with dorsally papillose anther surfaces and glabrous petioles; both of these features, however, are commonly observed in populations of S. madagascariense from other localities. Solanum marojejy is here considered to be conspecific with S. madagascariense. Solanum clerodendroides is a specimen of S. madagascariense almost certainly incorrectly labelled as collected in Nigeria (fide H. Heine 1967, in sched.). Unusually large papillae seen on the abaxial anther surface of some collections have been postulated to restrict access to pollen or provide support or orientation cues for pollinating bees (D'Arcy 1992). Only three specimens with lobed leaves have been seen, but lobed leaves may be more common in juvenile plants as is true in the Dulcamaroid clade (Knapp 2103). An unusual specimen at P from a cultivated plant in the garden at Antananarivo (s. coll. 2174, P04063654) is from a plant with inflorescences on many short branches and only 2-3 flowers per inflorescence and somewhat resembles S. humblotii, but morphologically conforms to S. madagascariense in terms of floral form, calyx size and leaf morphology."
wfo-0001031005,"Solanum sambiranense is a large-leaved liana (Figure 2A in Knapp and Vortonsova 2016) with very large showy flowers (Figure 1D in Knapp and Vortonsova 2016) endemic to the northern half of Madagascar. It has long petioles, long attenuate leaf bases, prominent tufts of tangled trichomes in the axils of the midrib and main leaf veins beneath (domatia, see Fig. 23 in Knapp and Vortonsova 2016), inflorescences with 3-10 flowers and foliaceous calyx lobes up to 6 mm in flower, often expanding past the developing fruit. Prior to the description of S. sambiranense in 1994 collections of this species were thought to belong to the similarly dendritic-pubescent S. imamense. Solanum sambiranense is similar to S. imamense and S. betroka and could potentially also be confused with S. ivohibe. Solanum sambiranense can be distinguished from S. imamense by its elliptic to obovate (versus ovate) leaves 5-10 cm (versus 2.5-5 cm) long, and glabrescent leaf surface with dendritic trichomes below 0.1 mm long (versus densely pubescent leaves with indumentum reaching 0.2-0.5 mm in length). The distribution of S. sambiranense and S. imamense overlaps in north-central Madagascar even though S. imamense occupies drier areas further south. Solanum sambiranense differs from S. betroka by its inflorescences with 3-10 (versus 1-3) flowers, calyx lobes 4-6 mm (versus 2-3 mm) long, and leaves 5-10 cm (versus under 5 cm) long with attenuate (versus cuneate to truncate) leaf bases. Solanum sambiranense is morphologically similar to and potentially confusable with S. betroka: both have a clearly visible brown fine venation network, green brown leaves on herbarium specimens, membranous glabrescent leaves without thick indumentum, and a similar habit. Typical representatives of the southern S. betroka and northern S. sambiranense are clearly distinct but specimens from the centre of Madagascar are more difficult to determine; the two species occupy distinct ecological niches with S. betroka restricted to the more arid south. Solanum sambiranense can be distinguished from S. ivohibe by its inflorescences with 3-10 (versus 10-16) flowers, and calyx lobes 4-6 mm long tearing for up to 2 mm (versus calyx lobes 0.8-2 mm long tearing for up to 1mm); S. sambiranense also occurs further north than the only known locality of S. ivohibe in Fianarantsoa. The distribution of Solanum sambiranense spans northern and northwestern Madagascar, from locations with more dry and seasonal climatic conditions than the wet eastern rainforests, warmer climate than the High Plateau, and more moisture than the south. Larger-leaved forms predominate towards the north and east as habitats get more humid.
 D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) state that S. sambiranense differs from other species thought to be related to it by its prominent domatia. These are dense tangled tufts of dendritic trichomes in S. sambiranense; no domatia are seen in S. betroka, but some increased trichome density in the leaf axils has been observed in S. imamense (Baron 1754). All specimens of S. sambiranense have membranous leaves except Perrier de la B&acirc;thie 13022 with membranous leaves on young shoots that become thick chartaceous on main branches. Grevé 241 differs from the typical S. sambiranense by its densely pubescent leaves, but with foliaceous calyx lobes clearly belongs to it."
wfo-0001020042,"Capsicum chacoense belongs to the Baccatum clade. It has a peculiar dwarf habit, profusely branched from the thick rootstock with small leaves, solitary flowers, entirely white corollas, filaments with conspicuous free auricles at point of insertion to the corolla and abundant red mature fruits per plant. Its most variable character is pubescence. Typically, plants are sparsely pubescent, but densely tomentose populations grow in north-eastern Argentina (Chaco) and Paraguay (Alto Paraguay), which, in the past, were recognised as a separate variety, C. chacoense var. tomentosum. Some of these tomentose populations were included in Hunziker’s circumscription of C. microcarpum var. tomentosum (= C. rabenii), leading to confusion between the two taxa. A second variable feature is the number and degree of development of the calyx appendages. The most common condition is the presence of calyces with 10 unequal appendages, the five main ones longer and alternating with five shorter, all of them usually well-developed (that is, appendages exceed the truncate calyx edge). In some cases, the shorter appendages vary from 2–5, with some exceeding the calyx edge and others scarcely noticeable, reduced to a mucro. Calyces with this second pattern create confusion in the identification of fruiting specimens, especially when all short appendages are not well-developed. Often, these specimens are annotated in herbaria as C. baccatum from which C. chacoense can be distinguished by its smaller and entirely white corollas."
wfo-1000020806,"In phylogenetic analyses, Capsicum neei was recovered within the Bolivian clade, resolved as sister to C. caballeroi. The demonstrated pungency of the fruits and the presence of giant cells in the pericarp are characters also found in the remaining species of the Bolivian clade, but, to clarify the other species not yet included in a phylogeny (i.e. C. ceratocalyx), the affinities of C. neei deserve to be studied in more detail. Capsicum neei is morphologically most similar to the Bolivian C. minutiflorum in having stellate, yellow corollas and red fruits at maturity. It is distinguished by its non-geniculate, pendent flowering pedicels and strongly-nerved calyx with 10 unequal appendages. In contrast, C. minutiflorum has geniculate and erect flowering pedicels and a weakly-nerved calyx with five equal, short appendages. Capsicum neei is sympatric with C. baccatum var. baccatum, which has geniculate pedicels, a calyx with five subequal appendages, white corollas with greenish-yellow spots within and globose to ellipsoid upright red fruits."
wfo-0001025653,"Solanum abollatum is unusual within section Irenosolanum due to its rhizomatous habit. This condition is not known from any other species of the section.
With reservation, I include Croft 110 in S. abollatum. St. John (1988) placed Croft 110 into S. nelsonii and erected a new variety, var. vadosum, for it. However, Croft 110 differs from S. nelsonii in a number of ways, including habit, corolla size, anther size and shape, and leaf armament. A few prickles are present on Croft 110, and unlike S. abollatum, Solanum nelsonii never has prickles. Croft 110 most closely resembles S. abollatum, however it does differ slightly in the lobing of the leaves. Inclusion of Croft 110 within S. abollatum also creates an unusual, and somewhat suspicious, disjunct distribution for the species, but from the herbarium material available, I do not feel at this time that Croft 110 warrants taxonomic recognition.
Unfortunately, Solanum abollatum could well be extinct. It was last collected in 1977. In 2008, I made a special search for this species. I visited both the collection locality of Croft 110 and the island of Lanai but was unable to locate living material in either place. The locality of Croft's collection was heavily disturbed by people with trash strewn about and a fire pit; a search of the surrounding area yielded nothing. The collection localities on Lanai are vague at best; however, several days of fruitless searching indicate that the S. abollatum, if it is still extant on Lanai, is very uncommon. St. John (1988) named this species after what he characterized as the lanate coating of the leaves. Though the leaves are densely pubescent, it should be noted that the indumentum does not fit the typical definition of lanate.

wfo-0001020090,"Capsicum frutescens belongs to the Annuum clade; it is a shrubby plant with 2–5 flowers per node, dull white or greenish-white corollas, bluish-grey or purplish anthers, upright elongate and narrowly triangular pungent fruits, a deeply cup-shaped fruiting calyx enclosing the narrowed fruit base and smooth, pale yellow seeds. It does not have as many cultivars as C. annuum and C. chinense. Flowering specimens of C. frutescens and C. chinense are sometimes difficult to distinguish in herbaria when fruits are missing. Venation of flowering calyx is a good distinguishing feature between both species since, in C. frutescens, the main nerves are often completely immersed in the calyx surface, while in C. chinense, they protrude conspicuously from the calyx or may protrude distally. In fruit, the distinction between these two taxa is remarkable; C. frutescens has deeply cup-shaped calyx enclosing the narrowed base of the elongate fruit, the pedicels are usually erect and a constriction at the junction calyx-pedicel is totally absent. Capsicum chinense has a flat discoid calyx appressed or reflexed to the fruit base, the pedicels are usually pendent and a noticeable circular constriction at the junction with the fruiting calyx is present."
wfo-0001020046,"Capsicum chinense belongs to the Annum clade. It is most popularly known as Habanero (Mexico and United States of America) or Scotch Bonnet (Caribbean Islands), but it has numerous common and indigenous names in South America (see above and Baba et al. 2016), as well as landrace and cultivar names (e.g. Carolina Reaper, Bhut Jolokia, Red Savina, Congo pepper, NuMex Suave, NuMex Trick-or-Treat). Many of the names refer to differences in the fruit’s pungency, shape or colour. An unequivocal morphological delimitation for C. chinense is difficult for two reasons: first, intermediate well-established types occur between wild and domesticated forms, probably due to intraspecific hybridisation (Pickersgill et al. 1979) and second, some specimens are hardly indistinguishable from their closest relatives (C. frutescens and C. annuum) at flowering or fruiting stage. Capsicum chinense is a short-lived subshrub or rarely shrub with 2–4 (–5) flowers per node, flowering pedicels that can be erect or spreading and geniculate at anthesis (mostly in wild forms) or pendent and non-geniculate (mostly in domesticated cultivars), a calyx with strongly-marked main veins that lacks appendages or is pentagonal or hexagonal in outline with 5–6 mucro-like appendages, a corolla that is dull white or greenish-white, fruits that are variable in shape, size and colour, deciduous or persistent, a fruiting calyx with a strong annular constriction at the junction with the pedicel and a clearly discoid fruiting calyx. The discoid calyx with a distinct annular constriction is the most conspicuous and consistent feature of C. chinense. The differentiation of C. chinense from C. annuum (wild or domesticated specimens) is sometimes also difficult, especially at the fruiting stage. Wild forms of C. chinense with small red fruits and erect pedicels could be confused with some domesticated (or semi-domesticated) specimens of C. annuum var. glabriusculum, which share the same pedicel position and fruit characteristics (size, shape and colour), although wild forms of this variety have smaller fruits than the typical C. chinense. The presence/absence of the constriction in the pedicel/calyx junction (lacking in C. annuum var. glabriusculum) allows the assignment to one or other taxon. Furthermore, C. chinense is a more robust plant with larger leaves and flowers than C. annuum var. glabriusculum."
wfo-0001028716,"Solanum irregulare is rather isolated in the group, but is most similar to S. sieberi of coastal northern South America. It shares with that species ellipsoid buds, simple uniseriate pubesence of the new growth and occasionally leaves, and elongate inflorescences. Further collections of this species are needed to determine its variability and fruit structure. The structure of the fruiting calyx in S. irregulare is unique in section Geminata, and it will be interesting to see mature fruiting collections of this species."
wfo-0001029047,"Solanum leptopodum is most similar to S. stipulatum of the rainforest of SE Brazil and to S. confine, also of eastern Amazonia. It shares with S. confine soft, golden pubescence, somewhat elongate inflorescences, and fruiting pedicels twice the length of the flowering pedicels. With S. stipulatum it shares strongly anisophyllous geminate leaves and completely orbicular, often appearing stipule-like, minor leaves. The leaves of both S. leptopodum and S. stipulatum are very shiny and dark green above and paler beneath. Solanum leptopodum is variable in pubescence throughout its range. Specimens from Peru and Colombia have been called S. loretoanum and are nearly glabrous, but intermediates exist between these nearly glabrous forms and the more pubescent type specimen from near Manaus, much further down the Amazon. The trichomes in all the specimens are of the same type, soft, yellow uniseriate trichomes, which vary in length in different areas. Some populations of S. leptopodum from eastern Ecuador (particularly in the Río Aguarico basin) have narrower leaves than the more typical plants. This character however, grades into the typical leaf shape, and no other differences between the two forms exist. "
wfo-0001026606,"Solanum bolivianum is a relatively nondescript species of sect. Torva. Characteristic features of this species are sessile or subsessile stellae with very short midpoints, glabrate stems, sparse broad-based yellow prickles, and very wide, often coarsely toothed leaves. It bears some resemblance to S. saponaceum (of Peru) but has consistently wider leaves.
"
wfo-0001022539,"Lycianthes stephanocalyx is a rhizomatous herb (that can sometimes produce above-ground woody growth) with white stellate flowers and equal, connate anthers. Its closest relatives are not yet fully known but are probably other species with equal stamens and stellate corollas such as Lycianthes heteroclita (Sendtn.) Bitter and L. geminiflora (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter. It was placed by Georg Bitter in his series Pilifera (Bitter 1919), but it is probably not closely related to the other species he placed in the series, such as L. pilifera (Benth.) Bitter and L. quichensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn. Sm.) Bitter, both of which are shrubs occurring at relatively high elevations (Dean et al. 2020). Lycianthes stephanocalyx is sometimes confused with L. pilifera in herbaria, because both species have flowers with equal stamens, and L. pilifera sometimes has one-flowered inflorescences. Lycianthes stephanocalyx does overlap in distribution with L. pilifera and differs in having red fruit (rather than dark purple), connivant yellow anthers (rather than free purplish anthers), and small whitish curved trichomes (rather than straight brown pointed trichomes) (Dean et al. 2020).
"
wfo-0001330986,"Lycianthes glabripetala is an endemic Mexican species that is morphologically similar and perhaps closely related to L. amatitlanensis (Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter (of Mexico and Central America), Lycianthes inconspicua Bitter (of Central America), and L. inaequilatera (Rusby) Bitter of Central and South America. Lycianthes glabripetala differs from those species in combining woolly curved trichomes on the abaxial side of the leaves, a relatively large corolla (to 1.2 cm long), nearly glabrous surfaces on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes, and a pedicel length of 9-15 mm in flower and 12-20 mm in fruit. Lycianthes amatitlanensis, usually has straight trichomes that project at a 90-degree angle from the midvein of the abaxial leaf surface, corollas 0.5-0.8 cm long, and very evident long trichomes on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes with these trichomes usually tufted at the tip of the lobe. Lycianthes inconspicua Bitter can have flowers as long as L. glabripetala and has variable pubescence on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes, but it has longer pedicels (15-30 mm in flower and 30-35 mm in fruit) and delicate straight trichomes that are tightly appressed to the midvein of the abaxial leaf surface; it also differs in having oval anthers. Lycianthes inaequilatera has smaller corollas and has pubescence much like L. inconspicua, and it occurs far south of the range of L. glabripetala. Lycianthes glabripetala is known at this time from the highlands of central Mexico in the states of Queretaro and Veracruz in cloud forest vegetation above 1000 m in elevation; this habitat is similar to that of L. inconspicua but differs from the most common habitat of L. amatitlanensis, a species that is usually found below 1000 m in elevation, often below 500 m, in humid tropical forest.
"
wfo-0001030573,"Solanum pruinosum differs from S. nigrescens and S. douglasii, with which it is sympatric, in its glandular pubescence. It is possible that these specimens represent isolated glandular populations of those two taxa, but in the absence of data showing this we elect to recognise these populations at the species level until further work across the range in Mexico is done. The three taxa share numerous stone cells (ca. 5-6, more in S. nigrescens) in the ripe berries, and subumbellate to somewhat racemose inflorescences. The flowers of S. pruinosum are intermediate in size between S. douglasii (15-20 mm in diameter) and S. nigrescens (8-10 mm). Label data from Martínez 1211 (MO) note the berries as rojo (red), but no other specimens have this data, so we suspect it is either a mistake, or an interpretation of purplish red."
wfo-0001022304,"Lycianthes dejecta is easily recognized by its dense, highly-branched trichomes which cover all parts of the plant. The truncate lamina bases are distinctive as well. Its fruits and seed type are similar to those of L. moziniana (Dun.) Bitter. It differs from that species in having maroon to black lines on its fruits, reflexed to curled calyx appendages, and microscopic fibrils on its seeds. All parts of this plant have a bitter taste, even the fruits.
"
wfo-0001022207,"Lycianthes acapulcensis is a very variable species, and it may be that some of the local forms deserve varietal status. It is variable in habit, pubescence (both trichome type and degree of pubescence), leaf shape, presence or absence of purple stripes on the corolla, fruit shape, and fruit coloration. However, the variation extremes are connected by intermediate populations (Dean 2004). Lycianthes acapulcensis may be confused with L. ciliolata (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter and L. rzedowskii E. Dean. It is separated from those species by both vegetative and floral characteristics. It is best recognized by its combination of white corollas that may or may not have maroon to purple stripes and its pattern of filament lengths (the longest filament nearly always more than twice as long as the adjacent filaments). The anthers have a lemony fragrance, which is unlike that of any other anther (pollen) fragrance in similar species of Lycianthes. The root shape (moniliform rather than fusiform segments) is helpful if underground parts are available for examination. On dried specimens, the length of the pedicels of the youngest mature flowers relative to their subtending leaves is often a useful character for separating L. acapulcensis from L. ciliolata. In the former, the length of those pedicels is usually less than that of the subtending leaves, while in L. ciliolata the length of the pedicels generally exceeds that of the leaves. Lycianthes acapulcensis appears to hybridize with L. moziniana (Dunal) Bitter and L. rzedowskii where the species co-occur (Dean 2004).
"
wfo-0001022447,"Lycianthes moziniana var. moziniana is separated from closely related taxa by its combination of green fruits, small smooth seeds (without fibrils on cell walls), a tendency toward having only one dichasial or no dichasial branching points, very elongate pedicels, and abaxially pubescent corolla lobes. Variety moziniana is separated from the other varieties of the species in having fruiting calyx teeth that are lax in flower and stay appressed to the fruit, cuneate (rather than attenuate) leaf bases, relatively dense and long stem and leaf pubescence, consistently pubescent abaxial corolla lobes, and an affinity for the soils of the transvolcanic belt (Dean 2004). This weedy variety has had an intimate relationship with the people of Mexico and may owe its current distribution to humans, who are probably its primary dispersal agents. The fruit of L. moziniana var. moziniana is edible and in past decades was gathered for sale at markets. Some researchers believe this variety was once a domesticated plant that has since reverted to a weed of agricultural areas (Williams, 1993). It persists under traditional agricultural practices by sprouting from its underground root system as well as from seed dispersed by humans (Williams, 1993). With the advent of herbicide usage in agricultural fields, changes in field preparation techniques, and lack of usage by humans, this once plentiful variety is becoming rare in Mexico (Dean 2004). In some areas of Jalisco and Michoacán, where this variety grows with L. rzedowskii or L. acapulcensis, plants with intermediate trichome, leaf and floral color characteristics have been collected or observed. Limited crossing experiments indicate that L. moziniana var. moziniana is capable of crossing with L. moziniana var. oaxacana, although with reduced fertility; crosses between this variety and mature accessions of L. moziniana var. margaretiana have not yet been performed (Dean 2004).
"
wfo-0001022446,"Lycianthes moziniana var. margaretiana is closely related to L. moziniana var. oaxacana E. Dean based on DNA sequence data, and it shares the attenuate leaf bases and spreading calyx teeth (in fruit) of that variety. However, its distribution is disjunct from L. moziniana var. oaxacana and presumably the two varieties have been separated for quite some time. Lycianthes moziniana var. margaretiana has several characteristics that differ from the other two varieties of L. moziniana: 1) upon maturity, the fruit exocarp can have tan or purple patches of color; 2) the placental area of the fruits may be purple, sometimes even of a powdery texture similar to the fruits of L. ciliolate (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter; 3) the pollen is somewhat larger than that of the other two varieties; 4) the stamen filaments can sometimes be pubescent; 5) the abaxial sides of the corolla lobes can sometimes be glabrous; and 6) this variety does not appear to be a weed of agricultural situations (Dean 2004). The fruits of L. moziniana var. margaretiana in Nuevo León are green with tan or rose blotches with seeds typical in shape and size for L. moziniana var. moziniana. The placental area of the Nuevo León fruits can be intermediate between L. moziniana var. moziniana and L. ciliolata (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter. Lycianthes moziniana var. margaretiana may be an evolutionary transition between L. ciliolata and L. moziniana var. moziniana. Intermediates between var. margaretiana and L. ciliolata are found in San Luis Potosí, Guanajuato, and Querétaro. The intermediate plants resemble var. margaretiana in vegetative and floral characters, however the branching pattern and pollen morphology are intermediate between the two taxa. The fruits of the intermediates are large, up to 50 mm long, the exocarp is rose-colored with the grainy light purple placental area typical of L. ciliolata, but the fruit shape and the shape of the fruiting calyx is that of L. moziniana var. margaretiana. Finally, the seeds of the intermediates have the texture and shape of L. moziniana var. margaretiana but are much larger (4-5 mm long) than usually found in that variety. More study is needed to understand the relationship between L. moziniana var. margaretiana and L. ciliolata in northern Mexico (Dean 2004).
"
wfo-0001029632,"Solanum montanum is a common plant of the lomas of coastal Peru. Some specimens are notable for the swelling of the subterranean caudex which forms a small ‘tuber-like’structure. Although this is not homologous to the true tubers of potato (S. tuberosum), this feature has given rise to its common name ‘papa de loma’. Field investigations of populations of S. montanum have shown that this character is not constant and may perhaps be related to environmental conditions (e.g. rainfall). In general, plants that develop a swollen caudex have a small, compact habit, and with leaves that are to some degree petiolate with a subentire margin. In contrast, other specimens have a more robust and spreading habit, with leaves that are strongly decurrent on a winged petiole and with a lobed margin. In this respect they are similar to S. paposanum from high altitude regions of Chile, with which they share the unusual arrangement of the inflorescence in which the peduncle arises some way along the midrib of a bract-like leaf. However, the leaves of S. paposanum are always densely velutinous whereas those of S. montanum are subglabrous. A whole range of intermediate forms can be found."
wfo-0001022476,"Lycianthes peduncularis is recognized by its combination of prostrate to decumbent habit, simple, ascending-appressed trichomes, small calyces, and round, green fruit with maroon to black striations. The fruits have yellow sclerotic granules in the mesocarp. This species may once have had a broader and more continuous distribution on limestone soils. It is currently restricted to limestone soils on either side of the transvolcanic belt and to some eroded volcanic areas within the transvolcanic belt (rarely on rhyolite) (Rzedowski 1986). In addition, this species may tolerate other, more unusual, substrates. In Oaxaca, L. peduncularis has been collected near onyx and marble quarries. Several other localities are in or near mining areas. Some of the populations in Oaxaca are atypical in the size and shape of their leaves, the long length of the longest stamen filament, and the straight style. 
"
wfo-0001022448,"Lycianthes moziniana var. oaxacana differs from L. moziniana var. moziniana in having spreading calyx appendages in fruit and in having attenuate leaf bases. It is closely related to L. moziniana var. margaretiana E. Dean (a northern variety found in the Sierra Madre Oriental) based on unpublished DNA sequence data, however it differs from var. margaretiana in lacking tan or purple blotches on the fruit exocarp, not having a purple, powdery placental area, and always having glabrous stamen filaments (Dean 2004). This variety was described from the Sierra de Juárez in Oaxaca. Since that time, many more populations of L. moziniana var. oaxacana have been discovered in Oaxaca, and it is possible that some of them are the more widespread var. moziniana. L. moziniana var. oaxacana is similar to L. ciliolata (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter, with which it overlaps in distribution. It differs from L. ciliolata in having pubescence on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes (versus no pubescence), having the length of the longest stamen filament 1.5-2 times the length of the medium filaments (vs 1.5-3 times), having trichomes of two distinct lengths on the pedicels (vs trichomes of one length), and having tricolporate pollen grains (vs grains with two pores and a remnant third pore) (Dean 2004).
"
wfo-0001022505,"Lycianthes rzedowskii may be confused with L. acapulcensis (Baill.) D'Arcy and L. ciliolata (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter. It can be distinguished from those species by the many internodes on its first stem, the usually poorly developed sympodial branching in flowering plants, smooth, white (rarely pale lilac) corollas, and broad sweetly scented anthers with terminal, round anther pores. In addition, one of the best ways to distinguish L. rzedowskii from the other two species is to look at the relative lengths of the stamen filaments. In L. rzedowskii the length of the longest filament is never more than twice that of the medium-short filaments, while in the other two species, the length of the longest filament is almost always more than twice that of the medium-short. Lycianthes rzedowskii may hybridize with L. acapulcensis and L. starbuckii E.Dean where they occur together (Dean 2004).
"
wfo-0001022284,"Lycianthes ciliolata is similar to L. rzedowskii E. Dean and L. acapulcensis (Baill.) D'Arcy. It differs from those species in having lilac rather than white corollas (or the very pale lilac sometimes found in L. rzedowskii). The pattern of filament lengths can also be useful in separating it from L. rzedowskii. In L. ciliolata the longest stamen filament is often more than twice as long as the medium filaments, while in L. rzedowskii the longest stamen filament is less than twice as long as the medium filaments. The lengths of the pedicels of the youngest mature flowers relative to their subtending leaves is often a useful character for separating L. ciliolata from L. acapulcensis. In the latter, the length of those pedicels is usually less than that of the subtending leaves, while in L. ciliolata the length of the pedicels generally exceeds that of the leaves (Dean 2004).

wfo-0001022352,"Although this species has not been observed in the field, it is obviously related to the species of series Meizonodontae and it is assumed that it has the characteristic tuberous roots. The fruit type is unknown and could be either the green Lycianthes moziniana (Dun.) Bitter type or the dark purple L. ciliolata (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter type. This species is similar to L. rzedowskii E. Dean in its white flowers, but it differs from that species in having fewer, larger leaves on the first stem to emerge from the ground, triangular, tricolporate pollen, and in growing in basic limestone soils. It is quite disjunct from the populations of L. rzedowskii (Dean, 2004).
"
wfo-0001022533,"Lycianthes starbuckii can be distinguished from other species of series Meizonodontae by its combination of prostrate to ascending habit, velutinous stems, thick-chartaceous leaves, lax calyx appendages at anthesis, moderately pubescent corolla lobes, and dark purple fruits with large brown to black seeds. Lycianthes starbuckii is unusual in the L. ciliolata (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter complex in its habit and pubescent corolla lobes. In these characteristics, it is much closer to such species as L. moziniana (Dunal) Bitter and L. peduncularis (Schltdl.) Bitter. Lycianthes starbuckii may hybridize with L. rzedowskii E.Dean, which grows in drainage areas near Nanchititla (Dean, 2004).

wfo-0001029287,"Solanum macrotonum is broadly sympatric with S. nigrescens across its entire range, and in Mexico and northern Central America with S. douglasii. It is similar to them in having usually 4 to 5 stone cells per berry and black fruits that are more or less shiny. It can be distinguished from S. nigrescens in having longer anthers (to 4 mm rather than to 2.5 mm) and in having more robust, longer fruiting pedicels that are strongly deflexed. It differs from S. douglasii in having strictly ellipsoid anthers (versus the slightly tapering anthers of S. douglasii) on longer filaments, and similarly in the strongly deflexed fruiting pedicels. Many annotations in herbaria have been done based on elevation (see comments in Bohs 2015) so care must be taken with these determinations. Measurement of anthers is the best way to determine identifications unambiguously. In general, S. macrotonum does occupy slightly higher elevations than does S. nigrescens, and appears to be confined to cloud forests, but S. nigrescens has a wide elevation range and ecological tolerance. Solanum macrotonum is also morphologically similar to S. longifilamentum, but as with S. nigrescens, differs from it in its longer anthers. Solanum macrotonum has larger corollas (1–2 cm in diameter versus 0.5–0.6 cm in diameter in S. nigrescens) and broadly deltate (rather than triangular) calyx lobes that do not split at the sinuses. The strongly deflexed fruiting pedicels of S. macrotonum are distinct from the spreading ones of S. longifilamentum."
wfo-0001342874,"The species resembles C. arida, but differs in having larger mid-stem leaves (ca 7-12 cm long vs 3-5 cm), longer hairs on both stems and calyx (ca 2-3 mm long vs 0.5-1.0 mm) and larger, more expanded, corollas (2-3 cm across vs 1-2 cm). The elongate dendritic hairs on the calyces, large leaves and large flowers readily distinguish this species from yet other taxa of Chamaesaracha. The novelty appears closely related to the smaller flowered, more eastern, C. arida; indeed, two plants from the type locality (cited below) were annotated as such by Henrickson. Chamaesaracha felgeri is apparently adapted to deep sandy soils and appears restricted to southern Yuma Co. (and perhaps closely adjacent Mexico). Some workers might wish to recognize this as but an edaphic ecotype of the widespread C. arida, this suggested by Felger 92-626, which approaches that taxon in pubescence; indeed, Henrickson annotated the latter collection and Felger 92-26 as C. coronopus var. arida [now C. arida]. I concede that it is possible that the two taxa might come into contact in Yuma Co. and form the occasional hybrid, although I have not examined plants of the latter from the area concerned. Clearly, both taxa are in need of additional field study. The species is named for the well-known southwestern collector, Richard Felger, who participated in the collection of all the specimens of the taxon known to me."

The clade consists of perennial herbs with woody underground rhizomes and slightly thick and fleshy leaves that appear succulent when compared to membranous species of the Morelloid clade. All species of the Episarcophyllum clade are distributed in dry habitats in Argentina and neighbouring Chile, generally above 2,000 m elevation. Solanum sinuatirecurvum is similar to S. riojense in the floccose pubescence of new growth, but differs in its large yellow berries (always over 1 cm in diameter) and flowers (2–2.6 cm in diameter with acute calyx lobe tips versus 1.8–2 cm in diameter with rounded calyx lobe tips in S. riojense). Leaves of S. sinuatirecurvum are usually smaller and more deeply dissected than those of S. riojense but considerable variation exists."
wfo-0001029163,This species is distinctive in having rather large elliptic leaves with tapered bases and a dense obvious band of scaly papillae on the abaxial anther surfaces. Vegetative pubescence is quite variable in S. luridifuscescens; plants can range from being nearly glabrous to densely pubescent on axes and leaf surfaces. Solanum luridifuscescens is superficially similar to and has been confused with S. melissarum Bohs of Solanum section Pachyphylla. It can be distinguished from the latter species by its stellate corollas with very short tubes and by its papillose anther surfaces.
wfo-0001429635,"Solanum tiinae is often identified in herbaria as S. aloysiifolium or S. cochabambense. It is similar to those species in its forked inflorescence with a long peduncle, but differs from S. aloysiifolium in its larger, less deeply stellate purple or purplish cream (rather than usually white) corollas, and from S. cochabambense in its smaller habit and winged stems. The strongly antrorse pubescence of S. tiinae is distinctive and not found in either S. aloysiifolium or S. cochabambense. Solanum tiinae can also be confused with S. gonocladum: Both these species are subshrubs that are markedly woody at the base with anthers ca. 5 mm long, but S. tiinae differs from S. gonocladum in its deltate calyx lobes with lanceolate tips (versus spathulate in S. gonocladum), capitate to clavate stigma (versus large capitate in S. gonocladum) and in its strongly antrorse stem pubescence (versus spreading in S. gonocladum). Solanum tiinae also resembles the highly variable species S. salicifolium, from which it can be distinguished by its shorter (1–2 mm versus 2.5–3 mm long) calyx lobes, the appressed strongly antrorse pubescence, the strictly forked (versus only occasionally once-branched) inflorescences with more flowers (10–20 versus 4–10) and the calyx lobes that are tightly appressed to the berry (versus spreading and slightly recurved in S. salicifolium)."
wfo-0001030401,"Solanum pilcomayense is a distinctive species of the Paraná River Basin with broadly triangular leaves widest in the lower quarter with truncate to somewhat hastate bases, large corollas and dark purple berries with two apical stone cells. It often grows in flooded areas along rivers and streams and stems can be very long and sprawling over other vegetation. The calyx lobes are distinctly spathulate, in contrast to the sympatric S. americanum with deltate calyx lobes and much smaller (1–1.5 mm versus 3–4 mm long) anthers. Solanum pilcomayense also differs from S. americanum in its deciduous (versus persistent) fruiting pedicels. Two very old collections of S. pilcomayense have been seen in the United States of America, in coastal Texas and New Jersey, probably from 19th century ship’s ballast, but the species has not persisted outside of its native range."
wfo-0001032170,"Solanum tweedieanum is one of the mostly widely distributed of the glandular-pubescent morelloid species with accrescent calyces in fruit. The name S. atriplicifolium was formerly applied to this species but re-evaluation of taxon circumscription and types revealed that the names for glandular-haired species with accrescent calyces were previously incorrectly applied. Solanum tweedieanum is most similar to S. physalidicalyx, from which it differs in having longer anthers (4–6 mm long versus 3–4 mm long in S. physalidicalyx) and a fruiting calyx that is accrescent but tightly invests the pale cream berry rather than the inflated accrescent calyx of S. physalidicalyx that is somewhat invaginate at the base. In mature fruit, the calyx lobes are longer than the tube in S. tweedieanum, whereas in S. physalidicalyx the inflated tube is longer than the lobes, but this can be difficult to see in herbarium specimens, and in the absence of mature fruit, determination can be difficult."
wfo-0001029804,"Solanum nigrescens is one of the commonest and most widely distributed of all morelloid species in Central America of America and the Caribbean. It is very variable morphologically, perhaps due to its wide ecological tolerance and occurrence in many different habitats. It is sympatric or occurs parapatrically with S. americanum, S. douglasii (in Mexico), S. interius and S. pseudogracile. It may hybridize with S. americanum in the southeastern United States (see discussion under S. americanum). Distinguishing features of each of those taxa can be found in the discussions of those species. Solanum nigrescens is a perennial and has been reported to be epiphytic. Where it and S. americanum occur in sympatry, the matte berries with appressed to spreading calyx lobes of S. nigrescens are distinct from the shiny berries with strongly reflexed tiny calyx lobes of S. americanum; anther length also differs (0.7–1.5 mm in S. americanum versus 2–2.8(3) mm in S. nigrescens). In central Mexico, were S. nigrescens and S. douglasii co-occur, anther length (3–4 mm in S. douglasii versus 1.8–2.5 mm in S. nigrescens) is a good distinguishing feature; in fruit, these two taxa can be almost impossible to tell apart. Solanum nigrescens and S. douglasii occur in very similar habitats, but S. nigrescens is a more Caribbean species on the eastern side of the Sierra Madre and around the Gulf of Mexico, while S. douglasii occurs along the Pacific coast and into central Mexico, but also does occur in the Chihuahuan Desert biome. Like most of these morelloid species, it is very weedy and occupies a wide range of disturbed and undisturbed habitats. In the southeastern United States (e.g., Texas) the distributions of S. nigrescens and S. interius are very close if not interdigitating. Solanum nigrescens can be distinguished from S. interius in its smaller seeds, more numerous stone cells in the berry and usually acute calyx lobe apices. The unusual pedicel articulation of the basal flower (in the lower third of the pedicel) in the inflorescences of S. interius has not been seen in S. nigrescens. Solanum nigrescens also appears to occur in more mesic and coastal habitats than S. interius, which is a species of the Great Plains."
wfo-0001429798,"Solanum caatingae is morphologically most similar to the widespread circumtropical weed S. americanum. It differs from S. americanum most strikingly in its spreading glandular pubescence of translucent trichomes (versus appressed eglandular pubescence of white trichomes), its usually more deeply and sharply toothed leaf margins and longer anthers (ca. 2 mm long versus ca. 1.5 mm long). Several other glandular pubescent species of herbaceous solanums occur in the dry forests of South America, but these are mostly from the Chaco biome and do not overlap in distribution with S. caatingae (see Särkinen and Knapp 2016). Solanum caatingae can, however, be distinguished from these species (e.g., S. michaelis, S. nitidibaccatum, S. physalidicalyx, S. physaliifolium, S. tweedieanum and S. woodii) by its calyx that is not accrescent in fruit with the lobes spreading or slightly reflexed and its shiny black berries with no stone cells. The glandular-pubescent Amazonian species S. arenicola differs from S. caatingae in its larger flowers (8–12 mm in diameter versus 6–9 mm in diameter), longer anthers (3–4 × 0.8–0.9 mm versus 1.8–2.2 × 0.7–1 mm) and smaller berries (3.5–7 mm versus 7–10 mm in diameter) that contain stone cells. Solanum caatingae can be distinguished from S. tweedieanum in its smaller anthers (1.8–2.2 mm versus ca. 5 mm long), non-accrescent calyx in fruit (S. tweedieanum has an accrescent calyx) and distribution (northeastern Brazil versus Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay)."
wfo-0001329053,"This taxon is not easily placed among the described species of Chamaesaracha. Averett (pers. comm.) favored a relationship to C. sordida, while I favored a position near or within C. crenata. Regardless, its isolated geographic position and restriction to gypseous soils strongly suggests novel status. The collector describes the plant as occurring in colonies, suggesting a rhizomatous habit. He also describes the fresh flowers as “green,” but in the dry state, on herbarium sheets, these appear greenish-yellow. George B. Hinton, from whence the eponym, is the son of the late Jaime Hinton, and grandson of the renown Mexican collector, George B. Hinton, is the only person to have garnered the present novelty, collecting this from an isolated outcrop of gypsum, well known for harboring a number of edaphic endemics (Turner 2008, and citations therein)."
wfo-0001028069,"Solanum galapagense can be clearly differentiated from the rest of the ‘Lycopersicon’ species group on leaf morphology alone. Other discriminating characters included appressed sepals that exceed the ripe fruit diameter, the presence of bract like leaflets on the inflorescence and presence of branched inflorescences (sometimes 2-3 branched, very occasionally simple). These morphological characters were found at a lower frequency in S. cheesmaniae, only rarely in S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium. Note that the presence of appressed sepals is not always apparent in herbarium specimens because sepals apparently curl upwards as they dry and can become reflexed in herbarium specimens, in live plants they remain tightly appressed until fruit abscision. Solanum galapagense has always been recognized as a distinct taxon (Darwin et al. 2003). Orange fruit color is only found in Solanum cheesmaniae and S. galapagense. This character is derived in these two species (Peralta & Spooner 2001) and separates them from S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum. Fruit color was described by Rick (1971) as a “dependable key character” with which to differentiate the Galápagos tomatoes from all others. Solanum cheesmaniae and S. galapagense are both endemic to the Galápagos Islands. The introduction of cultivated tomatoes and the evidences of natural introgression with wild tomatoes (see Darwin et al. 2003), generate concern about in situ conservation of natural populations. These two species can be considered endangered (see Knapp, in press)."
wfo-0001026981,"Solanum cheesmaniae is morphologically quite variable, but can be distinguished from its sympatric close relative S. galapagense by its less divided leaves, less numerous interjected leaflets, and shorter calyx lobes that do not enclose the ripe fruit. In the morphological analyses of Darwin et al. (2003) plants of Solanum cheesmaniae form a cohesive group despite considerable variation, but two extreme morphs show differences in leaflet shape, margin, leaf division and pubescence. The ‘typical’ S. cheesmaniae has very small leaves and leaflets, with entire to regularly dentate margins and dense pubescence in all parts of the plant, and bearing short glandular trichomes on the adaxial surface of the leaflets. These characters are consistently present in specimens collected from the north coast of Santa Cruz and Baltra, San Cristóbal, Santa Fé, Pinzón and coastal Isabela. The other extreme morph of S. cheesmaniae, called by Darwin et al. (2003) the ‘Academy Bay’ morph, has leaves to three times the size of the ‘typical’ morph, irregularly dentate leaflet margins (see Figure 4 in Darwin et al. 2003), and the plants are altogether less pubescent; the sparseness of trichomes is especially notable on both leaflet faces. The ‘Academy Bay’ morph has been collected from near areas of human habitation on southern Santa Cruz (Academy Bay = Puerto Ayora). Other specimens that we here consider to fall within the ‘Academy Bay’ morph show intermediate leaf morphology compared to the two extremes. These plants have a velvety pubescence composed of short trichomes of similar length; this pubescence is more apparent on the abaxial face of the leaflets. These intermediates have been collected in Isabela, Fernandina and Santa Cruz, and also possibly occur on San Cristóbal and Española. Specimens of the ‘Academy Bay’ morph have been collected mostly from the southern sides of the islands or at high altitudes (areas with maximum precipitation). Many of these specimens were collected during El Niño years (see Quinn & Neal 1992 for a list of El Niño dates). Hooker (1847) recognized three different species of tomatoes from the Galápagos, all based on the specimens collected by Charles Darwin. We found that one of these specimens documented as having been collected from San Cristóbal, and identify by Hooker as “L. pimpinellifolium”, belongs to the ‘Academy Bay’ morph. Some of the specimens cited by Müller (1940) as “Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium” are also assigned here to S. cheesmaniae ‘Academy Bay’ morph. Rick (1956, 1963) referred to three different tomato variants in Galápagos including a Galápagos “L. pimpinellifolium type” (TGRC accession number LA166), which had orange fruit but flowers with corolla divided 2/3 the way to the base (for illustration see Rick 1956). In his later work, Rick (1971) re-classified the Galápagos accessions of “L. pimpinellifolium” with orange fruits under “L. cheesmanii”. He considered the red-fruited tomatoes in Galápagos to be introduced species (C.M. Rick in litt. 1998). The leaf morphology of some specimens of S. cheesmaniae ‘Academy Bay’ morph from Isabela is similar to that of individuals of S. pimpinellifolium found in Galápagos and on mainland South America (coastal Perú and Ecuador). The morphological variation in S. cheesmaniae is indeed complex. Rick (1963) also recognized this and pointed out that populations from the type locality on the northern side of Santa Cruz are intermediate in terms of pubescence density between S. galapagense and what we here define as the ‘Academy Bay’ morph of S. cheesmaniae. He also observed that ‘typical’ S. cheesmaniae shared morphological similarities with the ‘Academy Bay’ morph but resembled S. galapagense with respect to its shorter internodes. Rick (1963) felt that the typical S. cheesmaniae had leaves that were less divided than in the two other forms and with orbicular lateral segments (see leaf variation in Figures 4 & 5 in Darwin et al. 2003). Our observations are consistent with these morphological differences noted by Rick (1963). Using AFLP polymorphisms, Nuez et al. (2004) identified Galápagos tomatoes as “Lycopersicon cheesmanii”, and designated some of the TGRC accessions we identify as S. cheesmaniae ‘Academy Bay’ as “L. esculentum” and others as “L. cheesmanii long”. Our AFLP data from the S. peruvianum complex (Spooner et al. 2005) indicate that if hybridization is occurring or has occurred, then AFLP polymorphisms are not useful for distinguishing species that may be hybridizing. We know that S. cheesmaniae and S. pimpinellifolium hybridize in the Galápagos (S.C. Darwin, unpublished observations), complicating patterns of molecular relationships. A comparison between herbarium specimens and greenhouse-grown progeny collected from the same plants showed that the greenhouse grown-plants had larger leaf dimensions than their field-collected parents, as is common in wild tomatoes. Size difference, however, did not wholly account for the differences between the typical S. cheesmaniae and the ‘Academy Bay’ morphs. Further investigations being undertaken by S. C. Darwin may resolve the relationships and taxonomic status of the ‘Academy Bay’ morph and to establish the reasons for these different morphologies found within S. cheesmaniae. Variation in S. cheesmaniae is potentially due to: (1) plants here recognized as the ‘Academy Bay’ morph could be an ecotype of S. cheesmaniae, (2) plants are potentially of hybrid origin involving S. pimpinellifolium, or (3) plants could be morphologically aberrant due to increased soil humidity found in the southern parts of the islands and during El Niño years. Results from allozyme electrophoresis (Rick & Fobes 1975) suggested that the populations of S. pimpinellifolium from the coastal region of Motupe-Olmos (ca. 6ºS latitude) in the northern Peruvian department of Lambayeque were most closely related to the Galápagos tomatoes. The spelling of the specific epithet has been corrected from cheesmanii to cheesmaniae."
wfo-0001019999,"Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum, better known as ‘chiltepin’ or ‘chilipequin’ (with some variations of these names) in Mexico and Central America (see common names) or ‘bird pepper’ in the United States and the Caribbean, belongs to the Annuum clade. It is considered the wild progenitor of the cultivated C. annuum var. annuum from which it can easily be differentiated by its fragile-stemmed somewhat prostate habit, very small flowers, calyx with 0–5 inconspicuous appendages, short filaments and small globose, ellipsoid or ovoid red-orange or red fruits."
wfo-0001341822,"Solanum rhizomatum is most similar to S. pygmaeum from central and littoral Argentina (see Barboza et al. 2013; Särkinen et al. 2015d) and differs from S. pygmaeum in having mostly forked (or sometimes more highly branched) inflorescences with 6–15 flowers, anthers 3.2–3.5 mm long, strongly recurving pedicels in fruit, and berries with 15–25 seeds, while S. pygmaeum always has simple inflorescences with 2–6 flowers, anthers usually >3.5 mm long, pedicels that are broadly spreading in fruit and berries with > 50 seeds. Although these sets of characters to some extent overlap, S. pygmaeum individuals are generally smaller than those of S. rhizomatum (10–20 cm high), with smaller leaves 1–5 cm long and 0.5–2.2 cm wide, while S. rhizomatum grows 15–50 cm high, with larger leaves 2.3–8 cm long and 1.2–4.3 cm wide."
wfo-0001030703,"Solanum pygmaeum is a plant that spreads by underground stems, often forming dense stands of small straggling plants along roads and in grassy vegetation. It is easy to distinguish by its large flowers (anthers more than 3.5 mm long), narrowly elliptic calyx lobes (1.5–1.8 mm long) , and rhizomatous habit. Leaves are quite variable in size, but are usually narrowly elliptic, less often wider in the lower half. It is most similar to S. rhizomatum of the Bolivian Andes but differs from that species in its unbranched (versus forked) inflorescences, larger anthers (those of S. rhizomatum are less than 3.5 mm long) and berries with 15–25 seeds (versus more than 50 seeds in S. rhizomatum). The two species are not sympatric. In Europe, the species is easy to distinguish from all other morelloids by its large flowers (anthers > 3mm long), narrowly elliptic calyx lobes (1.5-1.8 mm long), and rhizomatous habit. Leaves are quite variable in size, but are usually narrowly elliptic, less often wider in the lower half. "
wfo-0001030219,"Solanum paposanum is most similar to S. montanum, particularly to the larger and more branched specimens formerly considered S. phyllanthum. However, S. paposanum may be distinguished by the dense, velvety indumentum of the leaves, especially on the lower surface, and the almost triangular, acute lobes to the leaves. In contrast to S. montanum, S. paposanum is found almost exclusively at higher altitudes, usually between 1500 and 3400 m; only three specimens have a recorded altitude of less than 1000 m (Hjerting 1141, Ferreyra 4039 and Anon. 2199). Solanum paposanum and S. montanum have broadly non-overlapping distributions, with almost all collections of Solanum paposanum from southern Peru and northern Chile. It is one of the few species of section Regmandra that occurs in both Chile and Peru. The inflorescences of S. paposanum are unusual for the prescence of a small ‘bract-like’ leaf adnate to the peduncle and in some cases arising some way up the peduncle. This leaf is usually smaller and narrower than normal leaves. The peduncle arises opposite an additional, normal-sized leaf. Thus, the sympodial structure may be described as difoliate, with the two leaves separating successive inflorescences, or unifoliate if the smaller bract-like organ is not regarded as a true leaf. "
wfo-0001030430,"Solanum pinnatum is a morphologically variable species from Chile. The leaf shape and indumentum are particularly variable, ranging from small, narrowly dissected leaves with the pinnae almost needle-like (such as those of the type of S. maritimum) to much larger and more rounded lobes such as those of the type of S. novemlobum. An examination of a large number of specimens has shown that leaf size and shape are continuously varying characters and cannot be divided into discrete taxa. Consequently, a large number of previously described species are here placed in synonymy. The species can be recognised by the singly lobed leaves and usually dense inflorescences. The calyx and filaments are shorter than those of another Chilean species with lobed leaves, S. paposanum. Solanum paposanum also differs by its densely velutinous indumentum and narrowly acute apices to the leaf lobes. The fruits of S. pinnatum are unusual among species of section Regmandra because they contain a very small number of seeds; the majority of the fruit contents consists of stone cells. The low seed set (< 5 seeds per fruit) is particularly intriguing given how widespread this species is, particularly around Coquimbo and Valparaíso, in Chile."
wfo-0001027757,"Solanum edmonstonei is known from relatively few collections, and is restricted to the coastal area around Ica and the nearby islands of Viejas and San Gallán. This species resembles S. heterantherum Witasek., but has stamens of equal lengths, rotate or campanulate corollas and is usually glabrous or only moderately pubescent. "
wfo-0001031872,"Solanum trinominum is most similar to S. edmonstonei Hook.f., but may be distinguished by the unequal lengths of the stamens. From other Chilean species of section Regmandra, it may be distinguished by the lobed, densely pubescent leaves, often greyish in appearance, which are usually much smaller than those of S. pinnatum Cav."
wfo-0001030527,"In its broadly decurrent leaves on the stem, S. polyphyllum is similar to S. paposanum Phil., which grows both in Perú and in Chile, from 200–3500 m elevation. It differs from S. paposanum in its entire (versus margins with 4–5 acute lobes in S. paposanum) and glabrous leaves (versus moderately pubescent adaxially and velutinous abaxially in S. paposanum)."
wfo-0001027641,"Solanum douglasii can be distinguished from the morphologically similar and sympatric S. nigrescens by its longer, slightly tapering anthers (greater than 3mm long and in North America usually 4-4.5 mm long) and the minute free portion of the filaments. Both species are morphologically highly variable and sympatric through much of Mexico and Central America, often growing in the same areas; detailed studies are needed to establish whether interbreeding occurs between particular areas/populations in areas of sympatry. The two species have been put in synonymy by other authors (e.g., Edmonds 1972; D'Arcy 1974a, b), but characterised as ill-defined by others (e.g. Nee 1999). Solanum douglasii is most common west of the Rocky Mountains, along the western coast and southwesternmost United States along the Mexican border growing between 0 and 2,100 m elevation."
wfo-0001346399,"Solanum fernandesii is a member of the Gardneri clade. Morphologically, the species is close to S. agrarium, from which it differs by its smaller herbaceous habit, leaves with serrated margins and with a nectary at the petiole base, perfect flowers, and calyx lobes in fruit triangular, and suborbicular, winged seeds; whereas S. agrarium is a shrub, entire to lobed leaves, without nectaries, perfect and staminate flowers, with calyx lobes in fruit narrowly triangular, and subreniform non-winged seeds."
wfo-0001028370,"Because of its small flowers, Solanum heterodoxum has long been recognised as a species distinct from S. citrullifolium. Three geographical races are recognised as varieties (by Whalen, 1979).
"
wfo-0001029977,"In spite of its geographic remoteness from var. heterodoxum, var. novomexicanum is only weakly distinct and does not deserve the specific status accorded to it by Wooton & Standley. The two varieties are indistinguishable chemically (flavonoids)."
wfo-0001031210,"In many respects, var. setigeroides resembles Solanum citrullifolium var. setigerum, hence the name. The two taxa are similar in stem and seed morphology, chemistry and allozymes. Chemical resutls indicate these taxa have had a history of hybridisation (see Whalen, 1979)."
wfo-0001027231,"Solanum coquimbense is one of three species from Chile that have stamens of unequal length. Each may be distinguished by the form of the leaves, particularly the leaf margin. The margin of Solanum coquimbense is dentate, the lobes rounded and deeper than those of S. indivisum. The leaf bases of Solanum indivisum are cuneate and the leaves never petiolate, whereas those of S. coquimbense are attenuate and sometimes shortly petiolate. The leaves of Solanum trinominum may be readily distinguished from those of both S. indivisum and S. coquimbense by the secondary lobes arising at the base of the primary lobes. Additionally, the internodes are shorter (c.1.5–2.5 cm) than those of Solanum indivisum (c.3–4 cm). Although there are few flowers on the specimens of Solanum indivisum and S. coquimbense available for study, it appears that the corolla of S. coquimbense is rotate, whereas that of S. indivisum is pentagonal."
wfo-0001022421,"Lycianthes lysimachioides is distinctive amongst Asian species of Lycianthes in being a creeping herb of forest understories and shady places; it only occasionally attains shrubby proportions, but if so then it is less than a metre tall. The specific epithet reflects its striking similarity with species of Lysimachia L. (Primulaceae). The geminate leaves of L. lysimachioides can be mistaken for the opposite leaves of Lysimachia and coupled with the creeping habit, leads to confusion in herbarium specimens. I have seen several specimens of Lysimachia evalvis Wall. identified as Lycianthes lysimachioides; the plants are very similar at first glance. Like most of the species treated here, it is extremely variable in pubescence density, with some individuals densely pubescent and others nearly glabrous. Trichomes of L. lysimachioides are simple and uniseriate, and usually composed of many small cells, I have never seen branched trichomes in this species. Leaf shape in L. lysimachioides is quite variable, some specimens have almost orbicular, cordate leaves, whereas others are almost narrowly elliptic with acute or attenuate bases. Most of the infraspecific taxa placed in synonymy here have been based on pubescence or leaf shape differences. There appears to be no particular geographical or habitat correlation with leaf shape or pubescence density. Lycianthes lysimachioides is sometimes mistaken for L. biflora but is a creeping or scandent herb rooting at the nodes rather than an erect woody shrub, has a single flower per fascicle (only rarely more) and larger flowers (corolla 1.8–3 cm versus 1.4–1.8 cm in diameter in L. biflora). Identification of sterile or poor specimens of L. lysimachioides can be helped by looking for roots at the nodes and stems that collapse in dried specimens. The single collection I have seen from peninsular Malaysia (Henderson SF-22378 from Pahang) is somewhat woody but has clear roots emerging at the nodes and along the stems. Lycianthes schizocalyx has similar calyx appendages in which at least some arise below the calyx rim leaving a hyaline edge; it can be distinguished from L. lysimachioides by its shrubby habit, calyx appendages of variable length in a single flower and larger berries (1–1.3 cm versus 0.6–0.8 cm in diameter."
wfo-0001030696,"This species is closely related to S. adenophorum, but it differs by having only stellate hairs on the branchlets and lower leaf surface, petioles 8-18% of lamina length (30-80% for S. adenophorum), presence of very short, gland-tipped hairs on the lower leaf surface and calyx, 1-3 flowered pseudo-umbellate inflorescence (4-8 flowered and pseudo-racemose for S. adenophorum) and style 4-4.5 mm long (6-7 mm for S. adenophorum). Etymology: From the Latin pusillus meaning tiny or puny, a reference to the small size of the plant."
wfo-0001026321,"Solanum argopetalum is quite distinctive. It does seem fairly close to S. crassitomentosum because of its short prickles, without prickles calyx and relatively small flowers, but S. argopetalum is easily distinguished by its often gland-tipped stellate hairs with 8-11 lateral rays, the lobed leaves, the long petioles (30-65% of lamina length) and the white corolla. The populations of S. argopetalum so far recorded have all been on disturbed sites. At the type locality, plants were quite common on a strip of roadside land that had been cleared in preparation for the erection of a fence. The species could not be found on the opposite (relatively undisturbed) side of the road, even though the vegetation type was identical. The species name comes from the Greek argos- white and petalos- petals, in reference to the white corolla. Consistently white flowers are found in only a few native Queensland species. "
wfo-0001027613,"Solanum ditrichum is closely related to S. campanulatum R. Br. It differs from S. campanulatum by having pale seeds, acute leaf lobes, the calyx scarcely accrescent, finger hairs very short on upper leaf surface, and the stellate hairs rare or absent on branchlets. Solanum campanulatum is restricted to the greater Sydney area (New South Wales), as far north as Denman and Scone. The mature fruits of S. ditrichum remain green to yellowish-green at maturity, although they may have some light streaking of purple at the pedicel end (R. Fensham, pers. comm.) Conservation status: Widespread. Not considered at risk. Etymology: From the Greek di- meaning two or double, and -trichos meaning hair. This refers to presence of both stellate and finger hairs on the leaves of this species."
wfo-0001025743,"Solanum adenophorum has very long petioles compared to most other Australian species. The longest petioles are on the lowermost leaves, hence it seems that the petioles continue to elongate after the leaf has fully expanded. The taxon known as S. adenophorum in New South Wales (Conn, 1992) and Victoria (Jeanes, 1999) is referable to S. eremophilum F. Muell. (Bean, 2002)."
wfo-0001028226,"Solanum graniticum is closely related to S. pusillum, but S. graniticum differs by the relatively small leaves, petioles without wings, the lack of finger hairs and very short, gland-tipped hairs, the smaller stellae on all plant parts, the mauve, shallowly-lobed corolla, and the longer pedicels. "
wfo-0001030212,"F.M. Bailey, in 1875, was the first to collect the species in Queensland. Charles Moore had earlier collected it from “Liverpool Plains” in New South Wales. The next Queensland collection was in 1931, when a specimen was forwarded to C.T. White. He identified it as S. hystrix R.Br., a species from southern Australia, though he probably did not have access to authentic S. hystrix specimens. In 1939, while at Kew, he examined it again and determined that it was not S. hystrix, but “evidently a native”. In S. papaverifolium, the outer surface of the corolla often bears prickles. Only a few other species (including S. hystrix) display this characteristic. According to Symon (1981), it may be related to S. adenophorum and S. lacunarium. It differs from both in its absence of glandular and stellate hairs, from the former in its more finely divided leaves, and from the latter in prickle and leaf characters."
wfo-0001029691,"According to Symon (1981), S. multiglochidiatum is most closely related to S. prinophyllum and S. pungetium, from both of which it differs in its leaf shape, the larger and more numerous flowers, and possibly an enlarged subwoody rootstock from which the herbaceous growths develop each season. Symon (1981) counted 16, 20, and 33 seeds in three fruits. "
wfo-0001028916,"The bright orange prickles borne on the branchlets and both leaf surfaces of S. lacunarium are distinctive. According to Symon (1981), the inland population varies in having larger leaves with coarser lobes, and a measurable degree of change has occurred between these and the river population. The plants from the River Darling tend to be smaller and have narrower leaves and lobes. The species is perhaps most closely related to S. adenophorum, which also has a scattered disjunct distribution. From that species, S. lacunarium differs in having shorter, redder prickles, smaller, more lobed leaves, fewer glandular hairs, and paler blue flowers."
wfo-0001030665,"Solanum pugiunculiferum is a highly distinctive species, worthy of the monotypic sectional status accorded it by Symon (1981). It is totally without stellate hairs or finger hairs, it has hollow stems, very oblique leaf bases, tiny flowers (corolla 4-5 mm long) with disproportionately long filaments, and fruits that are quite dry at maturity. The often saline habitat is also very unusual for a Solanum.  Solanum oligandrum, recently described from tropical Western Australia (Symon, 2001) does not appear to be particularly closely related to S. pugiunculiferum although it is superficially somewhat similar. According to Symon (1981), this distinctive species has no close relative amongst Australian Solanum, nor has he seen material of exotic species that approach it. The apparently annual habit, striking, large, straw-colored prickles, absence of stellate hairs, campanulate corolla, short anthers, and papery seeds are substantial differences from any other species. Because of this, it has been given sectional status on its own. It is rather odd that there are no collections made earlier than 1919, which could perhaps suggest it is a late-arrived alien. However, the plant does not appear to be common, it is very prickly and has a restricted habitat. Although its biology is not well known, it is possibly a tumble weed. The fruits are never succulent nor attractive, and when finally dry they have a brittle parchment-like texture; the thin, flat seeds may be distributed by the uprooted plants rolling along. Symon (1981) counted (30-) 45 (-57) seeds in 10 fruits from cultivated plants. "
wfo-0001029758,"The most striking characteristic of S. nelsonii besides its unusual habitat preference is its habit&mdash;a mat forming prostrate shrub, unique within section Irenosolanum. Solanum nelsonii is most similar to S. caumii but differs in habit, leaf length to width ratio, sometimes in fruit color, and habitat preference. This species is named in honor of the botanist David Nelson, who in addition to another fateful voyage, participated in Captain Cook's third and final voyage to the Pacific. The type of this species was collected by David Nelson on that voyage.
"
wfo-0001030566,"Solanum profusum is one of several glandular-pubescent species of morelloids with accrescent to somewhat accrescent calyces occurring in north-central Argentina (e.g., S. physalidicalyx, S. physalifolium, S. tweedieanum). Solanum profusum differs from S. physalidicalyx and S. tweedieanum in lacking a strongly accrescent calyx that completely covers the mature berry. It has narrower, less incised leaves than either of those two species and has shorter anthers than S. tweedieanum (3–3.5 mm long versus 4–6 mm long). Plants in flower can be difficult to identify. Solanum profusum does not overlap in distribution with S. physalifolium, whose berries are not consistently covered by an accrescent calyx. Solanum profusum is a rhizomatous perennial and possibly clonal, while S. physalifolium is an annual. Leaf shape also differs, S. profusum has more lanceolate to lance-elliptic leaves, while those of S. physalifolium and S. physalidicalyx are ovate to elliptic ovate. The distributions of the three species do not overlap."
wfo-0001027229,"Solanum cookii has very long finger hairs on upper leaf surface, while on the lower surface, finger hairs are mixed with stellate hairs (with the lateral rays often poorly developed). Symon (1981) counted 386 and 563 seeds in two separate fruits. According to Symon (1981), S. cookii is most closely related to northern forms of S. prinophyllum, from which it differs in leaf shape and lobing, the tomentum (especially the abundance of glandular hairs), and in having more numerous and smaller fruits. "
wfo-0001031195,"Solanum serpens is one of three Australian species that exhibit a unique prostrate and stoloniferous habit, with long runners rooting at the nodes and sporadic erect shoots. The color and density of indumentum on the lower leaf surface is uniform within populations but can vary between localities. Solanum serpens at the type locality has an extremely dense white tomentum, whereas in specimens from Nicholls Scrub and Byron Bay, the tomentum is rusty and less dense. Solanum serpens is rather variable in morphology, and intermediate forms with S. acanthodapis exist (Bean, 2002). Solanum acanthodapis differs from S. serpens by: stellate hairs (on all parts) with short central rays (vs. very long central ray for S. serpens); upper leaf surface (excluding veins) glabrous even on developing leaves; lateral veins somewhat raised on upper leaf surface; ovary glabrous or with stipitate glandular hairs only (vs. stipitate glandular hairs and stellate hairs for S. serpens). Etymology: The specific epithet is from the Latin serpens, meaning creeping or snake-like. This refers to the long trailing stems."
wfo-0001025666,"Solanum acanthodapis is one of three Australian species that exhibit a unique prostrate and stoloniferous habit, with long runners rooting at the nodes and sporadic erect shoots. Well-developed plants of this species form a dense prickly carpet no more than 20 centimetres high. The fruits are borne virtually at ground level and hidden from view by the foliage. Bean (2004) did not observe any clues that would indicate the method of seed dispersal. Solanum acanthodapis differs from S. serpens by: stellate hairs (on all parts) with short central rays (vs. very long central ray for S. serpens); upper leaf surface (excluding veins) glabrous even on developing leaves; lateral veins somewhat raised on upper leaf surface; ovary glabrous or with stipitate glandular hairs only (vs. stipitate glandular hairs and stellate hairs for S. serpens).
"
wfo-0001029505,"This species is very distinct in the field due to its ground-hugging prostrate habit. It produces long trailing stems that frequently root at the nodes. The lack of a central ray (midpoint) on any stellae immediately distinguishes S. mentiens from the other two species with the same habit (S. serpens and S. acanthodapis). Solanum mentiens is closely related to S. corifolium, but differs by the prostrate stoloniferous habit, leaves 1.5-2.2 times longer than broad (2-2.9 times for S. corifolium); leaf apex obtuse (acute for S. corifolium); inflorescence with some flowers functionally male (all bisexual in S. corifolium); placenta sessile, semicircular to elliptical (not apparent in S. corifolium); and exocarp 0.8-1 mm thick (0.2-0.7 mm for S. corifolium). Solanum discolor R. Br. var. procumbens was treated as a synonym of S. corifolium by Symon (1981). Conservation status: S. mentiens is currently known from 3 locations. Weeds or land clearance threaten all populations. One population may be just within the Mt. French National Park. Applying the IUCN guidelines (IUCN, 2001), a category of “Endangered” is recommended (EN B1ab(iii,v)+2ab(iii,v); C1). Etymology: From the Latin mentiens, meaning ‘imitating’. This refers to its similarity to S. corifolium."
wfo-0001027792,"Solanum dianthophorum is morphologically closely related to S. ellipticum but differs from in several respects: the smaller stellae on the branchlets, upper leaf surface and lower leaf surface; the leaves only 1.5-3.5 cm long (3.5-14 cm for S. ellipticum); the lack of prickles on the branchlets and petioles; the shorter petioles; and the calyx less than half the fruit length and with 1-4 tiny prickles (calyx > half fruit length, with 5-50 stout prickles for S. ellipticum). Either S. dianthophorum is a very restricted endemic, or the type represents an extreme form of S. ellipticum. A field survey around Port Clinton should clarify the matter. Symon (1981) describes S. dianthophorum as a prickly plant, whereas Bean (2004) states that this species lacks stem prickles. Bean (2004) also indicates that this species is known only from the type, whereas Symon (1981) cites three collections and notes that he examined about 15 specimens. It seems that some confusion surrounds the identity of S. dianthophorum that remains to be clarified by additional morphological work. For this reason, the measurements and description of Symon (1981) have not been added to Bean’s description here."
wfo-1000050015,"Lycianthes textitlaniana is unlike any other Lycianthes species in its combination of glandular pubescence, relatively long calyx appendages, and dry turbinate berry with round-edged seeds with pitted surface. This species is currently just known from the type collection.
"
wfo-0001029344,"Solanum manabiense is unique in section Gonatotrichum due to the combination of its rhizomatous habit; difoliate, occasionally geminate sympodia; leaves nearly glabrous on the abaxial surface; unbranched, straight (non-geniculate) hairs; small flowers with equal stamens; and seeds with unexpanded margins and no obvious notch at the attachment point to the placenta. It is apparently restricted to coastal Ecuador in the Guayas and Manabí provinces. Solanum manabiense resembles S. olympicum, but the hairs of S. olympicum are geniculate whereas those of S. manabiense are straight. Solanum manabiense also resembles S. turneroides, but the latter is a more robust herb with heterantherous flowers that are much larger than those of S. manabiense. Solanum manabiense is also similar to S. deflexum, but the latter has leaves pubescent on both surfaces, is not rhizomatous, and has seeds with a swollen margin and pronounced notch where they connect to the placenta.
"
wfo-0001028148,"Solanum glaucophyllum can distinguished from other species in the section by its usually glabrous, glaucous, lanceolate to elliptic leaves with decurrent bases and short, slightly winged petioles, its rotate-stellate corolla with a relatively long tube and broad lobes, and its globose, purple-black, glaucous fruits. The stems are smooth and usually light yellowish or whitish, and the leaf midribs and margins are often thickened, inrolled, and whitish or cream-colored. Throughout its range, S. glaucophyllum exhibits great morphological variability, especially in leaf shape, which ranges from elliptic to nearly linear, and in corolla and fruit size. Narrow-leaved plants generally have smaller flowers and fruits than those with broader leaves, and narrow-leaved forms seem more common in the northern part of the geographical range of this species. This species grows commonly in flooded or swampy ground, where it forms thickets, known as “varillales” or “duraznillales”, of virgate stems from spreading rhizomes (Cabrera & Zardini, 1978; Okada et al., 1977). It is reportedly deciduous in winter (Okada et al., 1977). The fruits apparently float readily and may be dispersed by water (Nee 37532); they are also eaten by birds (Gibson s.n.). Solanum glaucophyllum is of economic importance mainly because it causes a disease, “enteque seco” or “espichamento,” of grazing animals (D’Arcy, 1974; Morris, 1977; Okada et al., 1977; Wasserman, 1974). The disease is characterized by calcification of soft tissues, frequently leading to death, and has caused losses of millions of dollars annually to livestock ranchers in Argentina (Cabrera, 1983). The active principle of S. glaucophyllum has been shown to be a vitamin D-like substance that increases calcium and phosphorous absorption (Morris, 1977; Wasserman, 1974). Extracts of S. glaucophyllum are currently being tested for activity as bone growth factors useful in human and veterinary medicine (Morris, 1977; B. Barr, pers. comm.). Solanum glaucophyllum is most similar to S. confusum of northwestern Argentina and adjacent Bolivia, and to S. matadori of southeastern Brazil. Solanum confusum differs from S. glaucophyllum in being frequently pubescent, and by having leaves with longer petioles, shorter corolla tubes with narrower corolla lobes, and yellow to orange fruits. Solanum matadori is glabrous like most plants of S. glaucophyllum, but it has stellate corollas, green rather than glaucous leaves, and is known only from Santa Catarina, Brazil. On the basis of morphological characters, Child (1986) considered S. glaucophyllum to be unrelated to section Cyphomandropsis. He removed it to its own section, Solanum section Glaucophyllum Child, included within Solanum subgenus Solanum. Dottori (1995) investigated fruit and seed morphology of this species and concluded that there were significant differences in fruit and seed characters between S. glaucophyllum and the other species of section Cyphomandropsis (S. confusum, S. fusiforme, and S. stuckertii) she investigated. These differences included epicuticular wax covering the fruit exocarp, ventilation cracks rather than stomata in the fruit surface, and seed coat cells with a distinct shape and pattern of wall thickening. While S. glaucophyllum exhibits some unique characters and may represent an isolated clade within the section, its tapered anthers, large angled seeds, and large chromosomes establish it as a member of section Cyphomandropsis. Molecular data from chloroplast and nuclear sequences confirm that S. glaucophyllum belongs to the Cyphomandra clade (Bohs, in press a, b). A few collections (Arenas 1407, Döbereiner & Tokarnia 794, 797, 800, Hatschbach & Guimarães 21941, Schaller 301) from ca. 20°S latitude in the Río Paraguay drainage are anomalous in being moderately to densely puberulent-pubescent on the axes and leaves. The pubescent plants were recognized as a separate variety by C. V. Morton, but under an unpublished herbarium name. Because they conform to typical S. glaucophyllum in all other respects and occur within the range of the glabrous forms, I do not consider them to be taxonomically distinct. Solanum glaucophyllum has often been confused with S. amygdalifolium Steud. (also known under the synonyms S. angustifolium Lam., S. persicifolium Mart., S. handelianum Morong, S. brittonianum Morong), which is sympatric and is found in similar habitats. Solanum amygdalifolium, however, is a twining or scandent vine with strongly ridged stems and ovate-lanceolate leaves. The anthers dehisce by broad pores that open into longitudinal slits, and the seeds are much smaller than those of S. glaucophyllum. Solanum amygdalifolium belongs to the dulcamaroid group of Solanum (sects. Dulcamara, Jasminosolanum and relatives; Dulcamaroid clade sensu Bohs, in press a) and, though strikingly convergent in several morphological features, is not closely allied to section Cyphomandropsis. Desfontaines (1829) published the name S. glaucophyllum in reference to a plant in cultivation in the Paris Botanic Garden. I was unable to locate a type specimen for this name, and a search of the collections at P by Sandra Knapp in 1998 failed to turn up any candidates. D’Arcy (1974) cited a specimen at MPU labelled as “S. glaucophyllum Hort. Paris Cat. Ann. 1829, p. 396” and speculated that it may be a type. Sandra Knapp in 1998 found this specimen at MPU, but with the additional annotation “h.m. Jul 1840,” indicating that it was grown at the Montpellier Botanic Garden in 1840 and thus cannot be a type. Specimens from BR, FI, and G attest to the cultivation of this species in the Paris Botanic Garden in the early nineteenth century. Dunal (1852) indicates that both the names S. glaucophyllum and S. glaucum were in use to refer to this species. It is likely that S. glaucophyllum was described from living material, and that no type specimen exists. Desfontaines original description is adequate to establish the name of this taxon. Later authors Kuntze (1898), Chodat (1916), and Hassler (1918) proposed a number of infraspecific taxa based on leaf color and size. All of these taxa are subsumed within the range of variation that are encompassed in my concept of the species. Solanum glaucophyllum was cultivated in French botanical gardens at Angers, Hyeres, and Dijon in the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century, and specimens are also known from Japan, Nepal, and the United States (Pensacola, Florida). It is not known whether the Asian plants were cultivated or adventive, but probably at least the Nepal collection was a deliberate introduction. D’Arcy (1974) speculates that S. glaucophyllum was introduced to Florida in ships’ ballast. It has not been collected from Florida since 1901."
wfo-0001026298,"Solanum arboreum is a misnomer since this species is usually a small shrub and is often rhizomatous. I returned to the type locality to re-collect this plant, and found plants corresponding exactly to the type in the Humboldt and Bonpland herbarium, but all were rhizomatous shrublets. Humboldt and Bonpland may have made a mistake in transcribing their field notes, or perhaps this species occasionally does occasionally attain tree size in the area. Near Cueva El Guácharo in Monagas, Venezuela, all of the plants growing in a 3x3 m square plot were interconnected by rhizomes. Solanum arboreum is also rhizomatous at Finca La Selva, Costa Rica, and in the Canal Area, Panama. In all these areas the plants are growing in waterlogged or clay soils and the habit is perhaps correlated with this environmental condition. The only other species of section Geminata I have seen with this habit is S. robustifrons of eastern Peru. Solanum arboreum is extremely variable in leaf shape, particularly in the shape of the leaf base. In northern South America, the leaves are petiolate, while in Costa Rica, they are nearly sessile, and the base is somewhat cordate. The character transistion is relatively abrupt and occurs in the vicinity of the Canal in Panama. Those collections with nearly sessile leaves often have long-acuminate calyx lobes, but this character extends into populations with petiolate leaves. The name S. enchylozum has been used for those plants with long-acuminate calyx lobes and sessile leaves. In conditions of severe root crowding (in small pots in the greenhouse) and water stress, individuals of S. arboreum develop even more extremely sessile leaves and crowded internodes. The morphological differences therefore may be at least partially environmentally controlled. Solanum arboreum is most likely related to S. ramonense of high elevation Panama and Costa Rica, sharing with that species papillate new growth, short inflorescences with densely packed pedicel scars, green berries on erect pedicels, and tiny white flowers with reflexed petals. Both of these species are apparently andromonecious, with both long-styled and short-styled flowers (mentioned by Schulz in his description of S. dolichostylum). Few berries are borne on any given inflorescence, and these are usually near the base. "
wfo-0001020129,"Capsicum hunzikerianum is probably a member of the Atlantic Forest clade, but has not yet been included in phylogenetic analyses. It shares corolla shape and colour, fruit colour and pungency, seed colour, seed coat ornamentation, chromosome number, habitat and distribution of the members of this clade. It is a distinct species of the montane forest of Serra do Mar distinguished by its general glabrescence, large and coriaceous leaves and large flowers. The calyx is the largest in the genus, reaching 6.5 mm long, with five long appendages (up to 5 mm long) and 1–5 unequal, shorter appendages (1–2 mm long). The corolla is unusual for its large size and white colour with few brown-purple spots. Capsicum hunzikerianum is sympatric with the morphologically similar C. schottianum. The two species share geniculate pedicels, stellate corollas and fruit and seed features, but they differ in the corolla size (10–16 mm long in C. hunzikerianum vs. 7–10 mm long in C. schottianum), number of calyx appendages (5–10 vs. 0–5 minute appendages), consistency of the leaves (coriaceous vs. membranous) and general indumentum (plants glabrous vs. plants glabrescent to pubescent)."
wfo-0001031257,"Solanum sinuatiexcisum is morphologically closely related to S. fiebrigii. Both species are large lax herbs with campanulate flowers and long, simple eglandular pubescence. Solanum sinuatiexcisum differs from S. fiebrigii in having strictly unbranched, usually subumbellate inflorescences with reflexed fruiting pedicels (versus forked inflorescences with spreading pedicels in fruit in S. fiebrigii) and in its narrowly triangular calyx lobes that are always longer than the calyx tube (versus deltate calyx lobes that are usually shorter than the calyx tube). Solanum fiebrigii is more widely distributed and more commonly collected than S. sinuatiexcisum where their ranges overlap."
wfo-0001026994,"Solanum chilense is remarkably uniform morphologically and relatively easy to distinguish from its close relatives (S. huaylasense, S. peruvianum, S. corneliomulleri) by its stems and leaves that are densely greyish pubescent, straight anther tubes, and long, erect peduncles. It is, however, extremely similar to S. huaylasense from Ancash in northern Peru, with which it shares the elongate peduncle and branched inflorescence. The densely canescent pubescence of S. chilense, giving the plant a greyish cast, serves to distinguish the two taxa easily, and in general, the flowers of S. chilense are larger than those of S. huaylasense. Rick & Lamm (1955) undertook a broad series of crossing studies in order to test whether or not S. chilense deserved specific status. They concluded that S. chilense should be recognized as a distinct species because it could not cross easily with other species, had a distinctive morphology, and occurred at the southern range of wild tomatoes. B. Igic (pers. comm.) has discovered populations of S. chilense in the region of Taltal in northern Chile that are markedly different in some key genetic factors. Herbarium specimens, however, do not show substantial morphological differences from other populations throughout the range of the species and appear to be identical to S. chilense in all major respects. These populations merit further study. "
wfo-0001029775,"Solanum nemorense differs from other species of the Solanum nemorense group by having simple leaves. The habit, flowers, and fruits of Solanum nemorense and S. barbeyanum are similar. The leaves of Solanum barbeyanum are always compound in contrast to the large simple leaves of S. nemorense. Although the leaves of S. nemorense are commonly lobed, they are not confluent or compound as found in S. barbeyanum."
wfo-0001026663,"Solanum brevipedicellatum is easily recognized by the large leaves, very short or apparent lack of pedicels at anthesis, and the strong exsertion of the corolla from the calyx before anthesis. It is a very distinct species and does not appear to be closely related to any other North American member of this section, though it does appear to be morphologically most closely similar to S. velutissimum from Bolivia. The juvenile form of S. velutissimum is especially like S. brevipedicellatum. Perhaps the growth habit of the latter species is persistently juvenile (neotenic)."
wfo-0001029811,"Solanum nigriviolaceum is handsome plant with large purple flowers, yellow prickles, and purple-black young shoots. It is a distinctive eastern African highland endemic with the unique combination of corollas up to 5 cm in diameter, anthers 7-9 mm long, prominent straight prickles, and trichomes with midpoints 1.5-2.5 mm long on all parts of the plant. Herbarium material of S. nigriviolaceum is frequently annotated as S. sessilistellatum. The two names were published simultaneously by Bitter (1923) and S. sessilistellatum has since been in common use from Bitter's description, although no extant original material is known. Jaeger (1985) found that specimens annotated as S. sessilistellatum matched the type material of S. nigriviolaceum. As these names were published at the same time neither one has automatic priority and neither has been used in the published literature although both names appear in the annotations of many herbarium sheets. We choose S. nigriviolaceum because of type specimen availability. The epithet nigriviolaceum is more descriptive and less likely to be confused with similar epithets. Collections of S. nigriviolaceum are commonly confused with S. aculeatissimum and S. dasyphyllum, both of which are common in the eastern African highlands. Solanum aculeatissimum has similar purple stems, hirsute appearance, abundant long straight prickles, and sometimes similar leaf shape, and but its flowers are much smaller with a more deeply lobed white corolla, and its trichomes are simple rather than stellate as in S. nigriviolaceum. Solanum dasyphyllum has similar straight prickles and elongated midpoints but its leaves are larger with secondary lobing and attenuate leaf bases, and its flowers have less dissected corollas and finer pedicels. The large corollas and anthers combines with high prickle density in S. nigriviolaceum are reminiscent of S. richardii, which is easily distinguished by its curved prickles and a more southern lowland distribution. The South African Solanum linnaeanum is somewhat similar to S. nigriviolaceum with its abundant straight prickles and sturdy habit, but its leaves are more deeply lobed.
"
wfo-0001031207,"Solanum setaceum is an attractive plant instantly recognisable by the long bristles densely covering its younger stems. It is a common and fairly uniform species with shallowly-lobed ovate leaves that are yellowish green on herbarium specimens and stalked trichomes 0.1-0.2 mm long on its vegetative parts. Stalks of some trichomes on the young stems lengthen and lignify to form the bristles, and stellate trichome rays are often visible on the apices of developing bristles. The bristles vary from long, dense, pale yellowish, filiform structures perpendicular to the stem to thicker, recurved, dark brown to grey structures that are further apart and similar to the prickles found in related species. Solanum setaceum lies within the distribution area of the variable S. hastifolium and has limited range overlap with S. taitense. It is recognized by its almost filiform recurved bristles over 2.5 mm in length, usually spaced less than 1 mm apart on the young stems, which are not present in any related species. There are no consistent morphological differences from S. hastifolium except for the bristles. The uniform nature of S. setaceum, its geographical coherence, ease of recognition, and common occurrence justify maintaining it as an independent species. Solanum setaceum may have evolved from ancestors of S. hastifolium and spread with Masai tribal migration.
"
wfo-0001031867,"Solanum trilobatum is widely distributed through India and Indochina. It was one of the first Asian spiny solanums to be described (Linnaeus 1753) and was brought into cultivation in European botanical gardens in the late 18th century. It is a distinctive species with its rhomboidal to triangular leaves that are usually widest in the lower third, but has been confused with S. procumbens, a similarly scandent plant. Flowers of S. trilobatum are much larger than those of S. procumbens (2–3 cm in diameter versus 1–1.5 cm in diameter), with abundant interpetalar tissue; S. procumbens flowers are deeply stellate with narrow corolla lobes. The two species do not overlap in distribution."
wfo-0001026821,"Solanum canense, along with S. suaveolens, are the only two species in section Basarthrum that have lax herbaceous habits. It can be recognized by the presence of 2-celled bayonet hairs, the large leaves with numerous leaflets with oblique and often cordate bases and usually small intercalated interstitial leaflets, the forked inflorescence and the very short, rounded to minutely apiculate calyx lobes. Solanum canense has been confused with S. suaveolens, a species with abundant pubescence, usually unbranched and fewer-flowered inflorescences, and flowers with long calyx lobes and shallowly lobed corollas (Anderson, 1977).
"
wfo-0001030561,"Solanum procumbens is similar to S. trilobatum and S. camranhense in its habit as a small scrambling shrub, but in molecular analyses of Aubriot et al. (2016a) resolves as closely related to S. involucratum, a much more robust and morphologically very different plant. Solanum procumbens can be distinguished from S. camranhense in its usually 4-parted corollas, slender fruiting pedicels, and more lanceolate leaves with less truncate bases."
wfo-0001030177,"Solanum pallidum is morphologically similar to S. cochabambense in its large flowers and highly branched inflorescences usually on long peduncles but is easily distinguished from it by often dense pubescence composed of branched (dendritic) trichomes on all plant parts. The two taxa are somewhat sympatric, but S. pallidum is confined to the eastern Andean slopes, while S. cochabambense occurs on both slopes of the Andes in Peru. "
wfo-0001026485,"The habit, flowers, and fruits of Solanum nemorense and S. barbeyanum are similar. The plants of Solanum barbeyanum are always have some compound leaves in contrast to the exclusively simple leaves of S. nemorense. Although the leaves of S. nemorense are commonly lobed, they are not confluent or compound as found in S. barbeyanum."
wfo-0001031654,"Solanum tampicense is a found in lowland swamps from Mississippi and Florida through the Caribbean and Central America with one collection from northern Colombia and one from northern Venezuela. It appears to need constant water and is common along riverbanks or in swampy, marshy areas. It is not common in Florida but it is listed as an invasive species and noxious weed in Florida and where it does occur it forms impenetrable thickets. This dense growth coupled with the vicious prickles makes it a species of concern in the swamps of Florida, where it is known as wetland nightshade. The lobed leaves, nearly glabrous stems, spreading stamens, and style that is often exserted parallel to the stamens make S. tampicense easily distinguishable from other species. It is sympatric through much of its range with S. aturense and S. volubile but has nearly glabrous stems versus the typically moderately to densely hairy stems of the latter. Solanum tampicense also has smaller flowers (>2.0 cm in diameter versus <2.0 cm in S. aturense and S. volubile) and smaller fruits (>8 mm in diameter versus <10 mm in S. aturense and S. volubile). "
wfo-0001030850,"Solanum richardii is an attractive and commonly collected scrambler with large showy flowers, large leaves, and prominent broad curved prickles. The distribution centered in the Zambesian phytogeographical region appears to be unique among African Solanum (White 1983; Jaeger and Hepper 1986). Morphological variability in S. richardii appears to be highly environmentally dependent; Milne-Redhead 1169 from Zimbabwe has curved prickles and mature leaves ca. 7 cm long, while the plant grown from the specimen seed has straight prickles and larger leaves, possibly due to more moisture being available in cultivation. The morphology of young plants that re not yet reproductive differs from that of mature individuals; Swynnerton 93 (isotype of S. richardii var. acutilobatum) has small hooked prickles ca. 1.5 mm long and shallow-lobed leaves, while the young seedling collected under the same number resembles S. aculeatissimum with its straight prickles up to 11 mm long and deeply incised leaves with acute secondary lobing. Populations from Madagascar and coastal Tanzania with larger leaves and rounded leaf lobes were recognized by Gon&ccedil;alves (2005) as S. richardii var. richardii while populations from Mozambique with smaller leaves and acute leaf lobes were recognized as S. richardii var. acutilobatum. Populations from southern Tanzania and northern Malawi with a dense orange indumentum of long-stalked trichomes and entire acuminate leaves on terminal branches were recognized as S. burtt-davyi and later reduced to a variety of S. richardii by Gon&ccedil;alves (1993). All the above are treated here as part of S. richardii due to the continuous nature of the variation. Mbago & Prins 2138 (southern Tanzania) has smaller flowers and straighter prickles on calyces and leaves than most S. richardii and it is possible that related taxa remain to be discovered in Tanzania. The South American Solanum acanthodes Hook. f. has been incorrectly cited as a synonym of S. richardii by Bitter (1923: 176) and Jaeger (1985). Identification of S. richardii is usually unambiguous. Solanum richardii is easy to distinguish from the more southern S. linnaeanum by its corolla 3.5-6 cm in diameter (versus corolla 1.5-3 cm diameter in S. linnaeanum), prickles that are usually curved on reproductive stems (versus all prickles straight in S. linnaeanum), and leaves usually lobed once with rounded or acute lobes (versus pinnatifid leaves with rounded ornate secondary lobing in S. linnaeanum). Solanum richardii can be distinguished from the more southern S. rubetorum by its significantly larger flowers, fruits, and leaves, and most prickles usually curved (versus all prickles straight in S. rubetorum). The boundary between S. richardii and S. campylacanthum can be unclear throughout the distribution range of S. richardii, but in general S. richardii has a climbing, rather than shrub-like habit, more abundant curved broad-based prickles, and broader corollas with longer anthers.
"
wfo-0001027626,"Solanum dolichorhachis is a climbing species recognizable by the very long and slender inflorescences, small stellate flowers, spindle-shaped fruits, and the simple, usually large leaves with distinctly oblique bases. This species is most similar to S. pacificum, but the wiry-woody stems, densely short-pubescent inflorescences and young stems, and oblique leaf bases set this species apart."
wfo-0001031589,"Solanum supinum is the only species of African Solanum with single flowers and an accrescent spiny calyx. Isolated in Solanum section Oliganthes sensu Bitter (1923) and Jaeger (1985) with no close relatives, it is the only species to have a rotate corolla with shallow lobes, a wide straight style never protruding more than 1 mm above the anthers, and bright yellow fruit. The flowers are sparse and inconspicuous, rarely seen on herbarium specimens. Frequently noted on herbarium sheets as being rare, but noted on SAGP/SAAB 1/52 from South Africa as widespread ruderal and weed of disturbance. Most specimens of S. supinum can be instantly recognized by their finely dissected leaves with deep rounded lobes extending ca. 4/5 of the distance to the midvein. The leaf shape of S. supinum is a highly variable character, however, and can be deceptive. Populations from around Queenstown in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa have all the characteristics of S. supinum combined with almost entire leaves and were previously considered to be a distinct species, S. leucophaeum. Collections with smaller finely dissected leaves are from the Transvaal region (Gauteng, Limpopo). Populations with larger wider leaves and larger fruit occur in Botswana. Pearson 9693, Seydel 4159, Esterhuysin 1185, and Hanekom 2205 from Northern Cape and Namibia have leaf shape intermediate between S. supinum s.s. and S. leucophaeum, with ca. 3 simple shallow rounded lobes on each side of the leaf. Skarpe 255 from Botswana has almost entire leaves and very few prickles, Mostert 714 from Transvaal has almost entire leaves and numerous thick prickles. The plasticity is not restricted to leaf morphology. Seeds of S. supinum are also unusually variable in size between the dissected-leaf morphotypes and the northern large-leaved morphotypes. The wide distribution area of S. supinum overlaps with that of many other members of the Anguivi grade ( S. capense, S. catombelense, S. humile, S. rubetorum, S. sodomaeodes, and S. tomentosum). The finely dissected leaves of S. sodomaeodes resemble those of S. supinum in Transvaal, the moderately lobed leaves of S. capense are close to those of some S. supinum in the Kalahari desert, and the greyish almost entire leaves of S. catombelense have been confused with those of almost entire-leaved and mostly without prickles S. supinum in Botswana. The identity of S. supinum can be established by its unusual single flowers, pentagonal corolla, and strongly accrescent spiny calyx."
wfo-0001030189,"Solanum pampaninii can be distinguished from the sympatric S. jubae and S. melastomoides by its foliaceous ovate or elliptic calyx lobes, as well as its scrambling habit and thin stems. Coastal collections of S. pampaninii with spectacularly large flowers have previously been segregated as S. pampaninii from inland and more pubescent plants with trichomes bearing elongated multicellular midpoints recognized as S. benadirense (Jaeger 1985, Friis 2006, Edmonds 2012). The variability in all these characters is continuous and the species as recognized here is highly plastic. The foliaceous, ovate to elliptic calyx lobes are the main character distinguishing this undercollected and broadly variable species. Fruiting collections are virtually unknown as the fruiting typically takes place in the dry season. In spite of the large variation in corolla diameter anther size is constant throughout the species. Label data note that the leaves are fleshy (Somalia, Bally 9344, K), although this is not obvious on herbarium specimens.
"
wfo-0001028203,"Solanum graciliflorum is morphologically similar to the sympatric S. cyanocarphium in being a weak, scrambling plant with hooked prickles, but differs from it in its branched inflorescences, smaller flowers and fruits and calyx that is not accrescent in fruit. The inflorescence of S. cyanocarphium is unbranched and the calyx strongly accrescent and covers the berry in fruit."
wfo-0001032260,"Solanum usaramense is a distinctive climber, easily recognized by its dense covering of small uniform hooked prickles, strongly discolorous leaves and fairly large flowers. The rare occurrence of this species and the paucity of collections from the coast of northern Mozambique makes it difficult to understand the morphological variability south of the well-sampled Kenyan and Tanzanian populations. We accept the poorly known S. usaramense s. s. with less indumentum and shorter calyx lobes sensu Goncalves (2005) as part of the same species from coastal Kenya and Tanzania incorrectly called Solanum monotanthum (Jaeger 1985). The same continuum of rare coastal climbers most likely includes S. malindiense to the north of S. usaramense and S. litoraneum to the south. Solanum usaramense is easy to distinguish from S. cyaneopurpureum, S. inaequiradians, S. lamprocarpum, S. stipitatostellatum, and S. zanzibarense; it is the only species with large corolla 2.5-3 cm in diameter, anthers 6-10 mm long, and strongly discolorous leaves. Solanum usaramense can be distinguished from S. richardii by its smaller flowers and shorter anthers.
"
wfo-0001025702,"There is considerable morphological variability in the leaves of S. actephilum especially between specimens from lower and higher elevations. However, from the material available, no taxa can be segregated. I include S. deplanchei Guillaumin here, but if S. actephilum were to be split it would likely result in the resurrection of S. deplanchei for at least some of the low altitude material. Solanum actephilum is most similar to S. camptostylum; however, S. actephilum can be easily distinguished by its longer leaf length to width ratio, poorly developed interpetalar tissue, and red fruit. One remarkable feature of S. actephilum is the occasional presence of prickles that project out horizontally from the margin of the blade in the same plane as the blade. Solanum actephilum is part of a group of native New Caledonian Solanums with relatively small leaves and short shoots which typically bear the inflorescences. The specific epithet is Greek for beach-loving. This must be somewhat humerous for anyone who collects the species in the mountains at 500 or 1000 m elevation.
"
wfo-0001027369,"Solanum cymbalariifolium is instantly recognisable by its unusual palmately veined leaves with 3-5 basal veins, dense filiform pale yellow stem prickles, and simple stem trichomes up to 1.5 mm long. This attractive and unusual Somalian endemic is only known from four collections; this treatment has been drawn up from Collonette 208 and Beckett 470 and the description by Friis (2006). One anther of S. cymbalariifolium is 1-2 mm longer than the others, a character overlooked by previous authors (Chiovenda 1925; Friis 2006b). There is often a second anther of intermediate length as well as slight variation in filament lengths. The buds and flowers are noticeably zygomorphic like of those of S. vespertilio and S. lidii of the Canary Islands and the New World section Androceras. Solanum coagulans and S. melastomoides from the same part of North Africa as S. cymbalariifolium also have zygomorphic flowers, but with unequal filaments rather than anthers. In the zygomorphic-flowered S. rostratum, the short anthers provide food for pollinating Bombus while the long anther deposits pollen onto the side of the bee, where it later comes into contact with styles of flowers with mirror-image reproductive parts (Bowers, 1975). No observation data on the pollination of S. cymbalariifolium is available but a similar mechanism could be operating.
Solanum cymbalariifolium is unlikely to be confused with other Solanum species in Somalia. It seems to be closest to S. cordatum and somewhat less similar to S. forskalii, and can be distinguished from these by its filiform prickles less than 0.5 mm apart on the young stems (versus young stems without prickles or with thicker prickles 1-10 mm apart in S. cordatum and S. forskalii), heteromorphic anthers (versus monomorphic in S. cordatum and S. forskalii), and simple hairs on young stems (versus porrect-stellate or multangulate-stellate hairs on the young stems of S. cordatum and S. forskalii).

wfo-0001022362,"Lycianthes hypoleuca is a distinctive species of lowland Atlantic forest from southern Mexico to Honduras. It is easily identified based on its leaves. The whitish, tomentose, stellate pubescence of the underside of the leaf surface makes the underside much paler than the upper side.
"
wfo-0001026262,"Solanum apaporanum is one of the few members of sect. Micracantha found in the Amazon Basin. The relatively few collections of this species indicate an extensive range throughout Amazonia. The type locality and many of the collections are from the area near the Parque Nacional Natural Sierra de Chiribiquete in southeastern Colombia with additional populations from the Iquitos, Peru and Manaus, Brazil areas. The latter two localities are the most heavily collected in the Amazon Basin and indicate that the species is likely more widespread but undercollected. The few, far-ranging collections make it difficult to assess morphological variability within this species. Morphologically S. apaporanum is similar to S. lanceifolium in having small (1-2 mm) recurved prickles, small flowers (corollas 7-13 mm in diameter), entire leaves, and small fruits (5-8 mm in diameter). However, S. apaporanum differs in having leaves that are widest below the midpoint with a long acuminate tip, and filiform pedicels (<1 mm wide) that do not expand at the distal end. The epithet refers to the type locality along the Río Apaporis in southeastern Colombia.
"
wfo-1200041500,"In Dean et al. (2020) the widely used name L. lenta was replaced with the name L. scandens var. scandens; this name change was due to the discovery of an older name for this taxon made during work on the genus Solanum by Dr. Michael Nee. Lycianthes scandens var. scandens is distinguished from the less common var. flavicans by having smaller sparser trichomes (usually less than 0.25 mm in diameter versus more than 0.25 mm in diameter in var. flavicans); the trichomes on the calyx are often so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. In addition, the leaf veins are obscure in var. scandens (versus prominent and whitish in var. flavicans), the corolla is purple (versus pale violet to white in var. flavicans), and the habit is usually a trailing vine (often an upright shrub in var flavicans). This variety is also found at lower elevations (usually below 500 m) than var. flavicans (to 1300 m), and it is very common along the Caribbean slope of Mexico and Central America, while var flavicans is more common along the Pacific slope. The two varieties can be difficult to distinguish in certain regions (Dean et al. 2020).
"
wfo-0001022517,"Lycianthes sideroxyloides is a wide-ranging species with obovate calyx appendages that are noticeably thickened at the tips. It has yellow to orange, geminate-stellate (multistoried) trichomes with 5-8 rays in a whorl. The obovate calyx appendages are similar to those of the wide-ranging Lycianthes pauciflora (Vahl) Bitter of Central and South America (Benítez de Rojas & D'Arcy 1997) and its relatives. Lycianthes sideroxyloides exhibits variation in flower size and flower number per axil, length of calyx appendages, as well as fruit size. Most populations have very short calyx appendages, however there are populations with appendages as long as 2 mm long. In populations with small flowers, the number of flowers per axil can be as many as 30 with the inflorescence appearing spherical. In populations with few flowers per axil, the flower size is larger. Similarly, in populations with few, large flowers, the fruits are larger. Seed size, however, is consistent throughout the range and is the same in fruits of varying sizes; the number of seeds per fruit is greater in larger fruits, with larger fruits having twice as many seeds as small fruits. Lycianthes sideroxyloides is morphologically similar to Lycianthes ocellata (Donn.Sm.) C.V. Morton & Standl., which differs in having glandular appendages that dry black, and to L. cuchumatanensis J.L.Gentry, which differs in having thicker leaves with denser pubescence and larger seeds (2.5-3 mm, according to the protologue [Gentry 1973])."
wfo-0001022462,"Lycianthes ocellata is closely related to Lycianthes sideroxyloides (Schltdl.) Bitter with which it shares obovate calyx appendages, stellate corollas, and yellow to orange, geminate-stellate trichomes. It differs from that species in having glandular appendages that are shiny and sticky when fresh and turn black upon drying. The corolla and anthers are also somewhat glandular and bruise easily when fresh, turning a reddish color. Lycianthes ocellata is mainly restricted to the cloud forests of Guatemala, however there is at least one collection from Chiapas, Mexico at the border with Guatemala that has black calyx appendages.
"
wfo-0001022295,"Although Gentry (1973) thought Lycianthes cuchumatanensis to be a close relative of L. limitanea (Standl.) J.L.Gentry, L. cuchumatanensis does not resemble L. limitanea and is very similar to Lycianthes sideroxyloides (Schltdl.) Bitter in its pubescence, branching pattern, solitary leaves, stellate corollas, and equal stamens. It differs from L. sideroxyloides in having leaf blades that are usually chartaceous to thick chartaceous, rather than coriaceous, have more rounded bases (rather than cuneate), and have less dense pubescence on the abaxial side. Lycianthes sideroxyloides also has a smaller seed size (1.5-2 mm long) than that cited in the protologue for L. cuchumatanensis (Gentry 1973). The paratype cited by Gentry in the protologue (Steyermark 48625) differs from the holotype in having less dense pubescence and leaf blades that are thinner in texture. Further field work is necessary to locate extant populations at the type locality of L. cuchumatanensis to determine if it is conspecific with L. sideroxyloides. The name Lycianthes cuchumatanensis has been misapplied to L. breedlovei and L. fredyclaudiae (Dean et al. 2019).
"
wfo-1000033129,"Lycianthes fredyclaudiae is a species of cloud forest that is known only from the area south of Coban in the Department of Baja Verapaz. In the 1970s, this species was often collected in primary forest in the vicinity of Union Barrios, but when this area was revisited in 2017, most of the forest had been cleared, and it was difficult to find the species in the remnants along the highway. One plant was located growing in a roadside thicket, after two days of searching the area, including two reserves. Therefore, it is assumed that the species prefers more undisturbed, lower light habitats, and the species may now be a rare plant. Lycianthes fredyclaudiae was misidentified as Lycianthes cuchumatenensis J.L. Gentry, a species related to L. sideroxyloides (Schltdl.) Bitter (Dean et al. 2019). It differs from that species in having rotate, mostly entire corollas (vs stellate corollas), and unequal stamens (vs equal). It is most similar to Lycianthes chiapensis (Brandegee) Bitter, L. breedlovei E. Dean, and L. hortulana Standl. & L.O. Williams. Lycianthes chiapensis differs in being a large vine climbing high into the canopy, having thinner leaves, and having trichomes with rays that are mostly unbranched. Lycianthes breedlovei and L. hortulana differ from L. fredyclaudiae in having stellate corollas and divaricate branching (Dean et al. 2019).
"
wfo-0001032475,"The morphological characteristics of S. volubile are similar to S. aturense with which it is sympatric in much of its range. There is much morphological overlap between these species and viewing an individual specimen without additional material for comparison makes identification difficult. In general, S. volubile is characterized by leaves that are chartaceous, often lobed and lacking a revolute margin, and only sparsely or moderately pubescent abaxially, whereas leaves of S. aturense are thick and somewhat coriacsous, not lobed and frequently have a revolute margin, and are often densely pubescent abaxially. Additionally, S. volubile has smaller flowers (2-3 cm in diameter versus 3-4 cm in S. aturense), smaller fruits (1-2 cm versus 1.5-3.5 in S. aturense) and smaller seeds (2-2.5 x 1.5-2 mm versus 3-3.5 x 2-2.5 mm in S. aturense). Due to their similar morphologies, it is unsurprising that S. volubile is strongly supported as sister to S. aturense in phylogenetic results. The etymology of S. volubile is unclear; it is possible that it is from the Latin volubil- meaning turning referring to the twining, scandent growth form.
"
wfo-0001022406,"Lycianthes limitanea is a distinctive, but poorly known and rarely collected, species of the Atlantic slope ranging from southern Mexico to Belize and Guatemala. It is easily identified based on its dense, tan to orange, multangulate-stellate trichomes, relatively large leaves, large calyces which lack appendages, equal stamens, and large, round fruits (Dean et al. 2020). Until the publication of Dean et al. (2020), the flowers had not been described in the literature, and of the twelve collections examined, only one collection was in bud and two collections were in flower. All the other collections were in fruit. Therefore, the flower measurements are based on dissection of a single flower.
"
wfo-0001030224,"Solanum paraibanum belongs to a group of eastern Brazilian species with a vining habit, recurved prickles, and large densely pubescent fruits with sessile stellate trichomes with long midpoints. This group has not received taxonomic attention and is likely to contain several new taxa. Solanum paraibanum differs from other members of this group in its more scabrous pubescence, its linear-lanceolate and reflexed calyx lobes, and northerly distribution.
"
wfo-0001029106,"Solanum litoraneum can be recognized by its membranous yellowish-green leaves with rounded apices and entire or shallowly 1-2-lobed margins, and by its inflorescences with up to 14 flowers. We have found investigation of this species difficult due to the shortage of material available to us for examination, but four morphologically uniform specimens have been examined for this study and these are clearly distinct from other Solanum species in southern Africa. Solanum litoraneum occurs within the distribution range of S. catombelense and S. torreanum. It can be distinguished from S. torreanum by its yellowish leaves on herbarium specimens (versus dark red-brown leaves on herbarium specimens of S. torreanum). Solanum litoraneum differs from S. catombelense by its sparse indumentum (versus dense indumentum in S. catombelense), larger inflorescences with 2-10(14) flowers and peduncle ca. 8 mm long (versus smaller inflorescences with 1-4 flowers and peduncle up to 2 mm long in S. catombelense), and corolla ca. 1.5 mm in diameter (versus 0.9-1.3 mm in diameter S. catombelense).
"
wfo-0001026501,"Solanum batoides is a densely prickly shrub with one or two red prickles 4-6 mm long arising from the adaxial side of the leaf and protruding several millimetres beyond the leaf. It forms bramble-like thickets on the south of Madagascar (D'Arcy 1992).
Solanum batoides can be confused with the sympatric small-leaved S. erythracanthum and S. toliaraea. It can be distinguished from S. erythracanthum by its pedicels under 1.5 cm long (versus over 1.5 cm long), leaves positioned on short shoots (versus at least some leaves on main branches) and leaves under 2 cm long (versus mostly over 2 cm long). Solanum batoides differs from S. toliaraea by its calyx that reaches a maximum of 5 mm and bears no more than 2-3 prickles in fruit (versus a strongly accrescent calyx that encloses the mature fruit, developing a dense cover of prickles during fruit development). Distinguishing S. toliaraea and S. batoides without the presence of a fruiting calyx can be more difficult; the leaves of S. batoides are usually discolorous (vs. almost always concolorous), dry brownish green (vs. yellowish green), and S. batoides reaches no higher than 1 m (versus up to 4 m). We adopt a narrower species concept of Solanum batoides than the one originally employed by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994). Specimens with filiform pedicels over 1.5 cm long, specimens with deeply lobed leaves over 2 cm long and specimens with flat spines over 3 mm wide at base have been referred to S. erythracanthum. Some collections that do not fit within the species boundaries of either S. batoides or S. erythracanthum have recently been made from Toliara; DuPuy et al. M874 has unusually deep leaf lobing and elongated filiform pedicels; and Phillipson 3026 has attenuate leaf bases and long pedicels. We have included them here in S. batoides, but further collecting and assessment of population variability may reveal they represent new taxa.
"
wfo-0001031480,"Solanum stipitatostellatum is a robust plant with almost entire reddish leaves, large inflorescences, prickles small or absent, and trichomes with stalks 0.1-0.4 mm long. The fruit is markedly elongate during development and becomes spherical at maturity. Solanum stipitatostellatum includes variable populations from across the Usambara area with different rainfall patterns. The corolla size ranges between 1.8-3 cm in diameter, and the majority of specimens have a pedunculate inflorescence with 4-10 flowers. Solanum stipitatostellatum as recognized here includes five of Dammer's Tanzanian species with different corolla measurements (Dammer 1894, 1895, 1906). Care must be taken with identification of this species. Most S. stipitatostellatum herbarium material is currently held under the names S. englerianum, S. glochidiatum and S. kitivuense. Specimens annotated as sp. near stipitatostellatum are often of S. taitense. Solanum stipitatostellatum has some distribution overlap with S. taitense and both taxa have stalked trichomes, but S. stipitatostellatum has mature leaves 6-13 mm long (versus leaves 1.2-3(3.5) cm long in S. taitense) and 3-10 flowers per inflorescence (versus 1-3(3) flowers per inflorescence in S. taitense). Solanum stipitatostellatum lies within the distribution range of S. zanzibarense and near the superficially similar S. cyaneopurpureum, S. inaequiradians, S. lamprocarpum, and S. usaramense. Solanum stipitatostellatum differs from S. zanzibarense by its corolla 1.8-3 cm in diameter (versus corolla 1.5-2 cm diameter in S. zanzibarense), anthers 6-8 mm long (versus anthers 4-6.5 mm long in S. zanzibarense), inconspicuous prickles less than 2 mm long if present (versus prickles over 2 mm long in S. zanzibarense), and trichomes with stalks 0.1-0.4 mm long (versus sessile or with stalks up to 0.1 mm long in S. zanzibarense). Solanum stipitatostellatum appears close to S. inaequiradians with its acuminate leaves and trichomes with midpoints that are sometimes elongated to 0.7 mm. It can be distinguished from S. inaequiradians by its calyx lobes that are shorter than the corolla in bud (versus calyx lobes longer than the corolla throughout bud development in S. inaequiradians), calyx 4-6 mm long in flower and 5-8 mm long in fruit (versus calyx 7-9 mm long in flower and 10-12 mm long in fruit in S. inaequiradians), and trichomes with midpoints that are usually shorter than the midpoints and never extend beyond 0.7 mm (versus midpoints 1-2 mm long on all parts of the plant in S. inaequiradians). Solanum stipitatostellatum differs from S. lamprocarpum by its corolla 1.8-3 cm in diameter (versus corolla ca. 1.7 cm in diameter in S. lamprocarpum), ovate subentire leaves (versus elliptic to obovate lobed leaves in S. lamprocarpum), and trichomes with reduced midpoints, occasionally elongated to 0.7 mm on the young stems (versus trichomes with midpoints 0.7-1 mm long throughout the plant in S. lamprocarpum). Solanum usaramense is easy to distinguish by its abundant uniform hooked prickles ca. 1 mm long, strongly discolorous leaves, and trichomes with stalks 0.2-0.3 mm long. Solanum cyaneopurpureum is also markedly different from S. stipitatostellatum with its yellowish color on herbarium specimens, leaves usually under 5 cm long, corolla under 2 cm in diameter, and anthers less than 6.5 mm long.
"
wfo-0001028547,"Solanum inaequiradians occurs within the distribution range of S. zanzibarense. It is similar to S. zanzibarense in its small flowers with narrow corolla lobes, leaf shape, and climbing habit; it can be distinguished by its long-attenuate calyx lobes exceeding the corolla in bud, 7-9 mm long in flower, and 10-12 mm long in fruit (versus calyx lobes shorter than corolla in bud and 2-4 mm long in flower and fruit in S. zanzibarense), and trichomes with midpoints 1.5-3 mm long (versus trichomes with midpoints reduced or up to 0.2 mm long in S. zanzibarense). Solanum inaequiradians can also be confused with the morphologically similar S. lamprocarpum, S. stipitatostellatum, and S. usaramense. Solanum stipitatostellatum is morphologically similar to S. inaequiradians with its acuminate leaves, dense indumentum and trichomes with midpoints that are sometimes elongated. Jaeger (1985) suggested the possibility of including S. inaequiradians within S. stipitatostellatum, but S. inaequiradians is clearly distinguished by its long calyx lobes (versus calyx lobes shorter than the corolla in bud, 4-6 mm long in flower and 5-8 mm long in fruit in S. stipitatostellatum), and trichomes with long midpoints (versus midpoints that are usually shorter than the rays and never extend beyond 0.7 mm in S. stipitatostellatum). Solanum inaequiradians is reminiscent of S. usaramense with its small hooked stem prickles and discolorous leaves, and similar to S. lamprocarpum with its elongated midpoints; it can be distinguished from both of these by its long calyx lobes.
"
wfo-0001030919,"Solanum rubicaule has a festooning growth form, meaning that it is often arched and draping over other vegetation. This growth form is similar to members of Solanum sect. Micracantha Dunal, a group of vining species from the New World tropics that climb using recurved prickles. This superficial similarity explains why specimens of Solanum rubicaule are often annotated as Solanum sect. Micracantha. However, other morphological and molecular characters place Solanum rubicaule in Solanum sect. Torva, including flowers with triangular corolla lobes with abundant interpetalar tissue and typically branched inflorescences. Parsimony analyses of sequence data from three molecular markers (nuclear ITS and waxy or GBSSI and chloroplast trnT-F) also place Solanum rubicaule in sect. Torva; however, the relationships within the section are not well-resolved and require further study (S. Stern and L. Bohs, unpub. data). Within sect. Torva, Solanum rubicaule is similar to Solanum subinerme Jacq., a species found throughout northern South America from the Guianas to central Peru, both of which have a scandent growth form and few-branched inflorescences. However, Solanum rubicaule has a distinctive infructescence with fruits held horizontal to the rachis due to pedicels that curve downward while Solanum subinerme has fruits held upright on erect pedicels. The adaxial leaf surface of Solanum rubicaule is without prickles, while the adaxial leaf surface of Solanum subinerme often has straight prickles to 1.5 cm long. Both species have multiseriate stalked hairs on the adaxial leaf surface but those Solanum subinerme are nearly sessile to short stalked (to ca. 0.4 mm) and very thin (ca. 0.1 mm in diameter) while those of Solanum rubicaule reach 0.6 mm with greatly thickened stalks (to 0.3 mm in diameter). Herbarium specimens of Solanum rubicaule and Solanum asperolanatum Ruiz & Pav. are very similarwith regard to pubescence and flower appearance, but the latter species has upright inflorescences that are more than twice branched, typically has>12 flowers, is a large shrub or small tree and does not have the festooning growth form of Solanum rubicaule.
"
wfo-0001022450,"Lycianthes multiflora is one of the most commonly collected species in Central America and is present in a variety of wet forest habitats over a relatively broad elevational range. Its life form can range from epiphyte to shrub to vine. It exhibits a wide variation in trichome density between populations (especially on the calyx and corolla). Its combination of mostly multangulate-stellate, whitish to pale yellow-orange trichomes with crisped rays that often lay appressed to the leaf surface of the adaxial side of the leaf blade, white to lilac mostly entire corollas with abundant interpetiolar tissue, and unequal stamens separate it from many of the other species that grow in Central America. In fruit, L. multiflora could be confused with Lycianthes sideroxyloides (Schltdl.) Bitter, a species with stellate corollas and equal stamens, with which it overlaps north of Costa Rica. The two species differ in calyx appendage shape (widely obovate in L. sideroxyloides vs linear or with slight swelling at tip in L. multiflora) and trichome morphology (often geminate-stellate trichomes in L. sideroxyloides vs multangulate-stellate in L. multiflora) (see Roe, 1971 for trichome terminology definitions). Lycianthes multiflora is also somewhat similar to L. pauciflora (Vahl) Bitter, which differs in usually having a glabrous corolla (versus often pubescent in L. multiflora) and having a very smooth calyx with appendages that are wider at the tip than at the base; in addition, in L. pauciflora, the calyx in fruit is larger with wider appendages."
wfo-0001026272,"Solanum apiculatum as delimited here can be easily recognised by its shrubby or lianascent habit, scabrous upper leaf surfaces with porrect stellate trichomes with a 1-3 celled midpoint, branched (3x) inflorescences with many flowers and a long (to 7 cm) peduncle. The inflorescences are congested, the flowers short-pedicellate and the calyx campanulate with oblong lobes. This species ressembles the more widely distributed S. rhytidoandrum, with which it shares branched inflorescences and white corollas. Solanum apiculatum differs from that species in its scandent habit, very congested inflorescences with flowers on short pedicels, oblong (rather than cuspidate) calyx lobes and apiculate berry with a denser, rusty-red pericarp indument of simple glandular (rather than stellate) trichomes."
wfo-0001342062,"Solanum camranhense is morphologically similar to the sympatric S. robinsonii, but differs from that species in its scandent (versus erect) habit, the denser pubescence that dries yellowish brown, shorter leaves (2–3.5 cm long versus 3–8 cm long in S. robinsonii), and smaller, more deeply lobed corollas (usually less than 1 cm in diameter and lobed 3/4 of the way to the base versus 1–2 cm in diameter and only lobed halfway to the base in S. robinsonii). Hul and Dy Phon (2014) described S. camranhense as unarmed, but we have seen specimens with a few scattered prickles on the scandent stems. The two species differ in habitat; S. camranhense is a plant of coastal dunes, while S. robinsonii occurs in coastal forests."
wfo-0001027234,"Solanum cordatum can usually be recognized by its long-filiform pedicels exceeding the leaves and membranous glaucous glabrescent leaves with long-decurrent narrowly-winged petioles. Unfortunately, neither of these characters is constant and it is important to look at the indumentum under the microscope; trichomes on the young stems of S. cordatum are compact and multangulate, with rays almost always under 0.1 mm long, and a small glandular tip is sometimes present on the midpoint of trichomes of stems, young leaves or both. The indumentum character is constant with the exception of a few collections from Somalia with longer-rayed stem trichomes. Label data records rooting easily on contact with the ground and at the nodes (Ellis 151, K, Collenette 5986, K) and fruit like cherry tomatoes (Wieland 4659, K); several collections from India and Pakistan record the flower color as white. Solanum cordatum is frequently confused with the variable and largely sympatric S. forskalii. Solanum cordatum can be distinguished from S. forskalii by its multangulate trichomes with 12-18 rays under 0.15 mm long on the young stems (versus porrect trichomes with 6-10 rays over 0.15 mm long on the young stems of S. forskalii), 1-2 flowers per inflorescence (versus 1-20 flowers per inflorescence in S. forskalii), and anthers 3-5 mm long (versus anthers 4.5-7 mm long in S. forskalii). The two species occupy largely the same areas of northeastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India; S. forskalii is not known in Oman but occurs further west than S. cordatum in Egypt and Sudan. There is a clear morphological distinction between the two species in Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, where S. forskalii has branched many-flowered inflorescences and dense indumentum. The separation is less clear in Somalia, Kenya and southern Arabian Peninsula; S. forskalii is more variable there with fewer flowers per inflorescence and smaller leaves. Carter & Stannard 583 from northern Kenya appears morphologically intermediate between the two species, with long-rayed porrect stem trichomes and anthers 7 mm long like S. forskalii but leaf morphology similar to S. cordatum. Solanum cordatum grows in grassland or open woodland, sheds foliage during drought and displays opportunistic growth in wet periods; S. forskalii grows in more open and rocky habitats, preserving water throughout the dry season with its dense indumentum cover and tougher tissue. Solanum cordatum is similar to the rare Somalian endemic S. cymbalariifolium, and can be distinguished by its stellate-multangulate trichomes on the young stems (versus long simple trichomes visible with the naked eye on the young stems of S. cymbalariifolium), no prickles or prickles up to 4 mm long and more than 3 mm apart (versus dense filiform prickles 4-10 mm long and less than 0.5 mm apart on young stems in S. cymbalariifolium), and entire penninerved leaves (versus lobed leaves with 3-5 veins at the base of the leaf in S. cymbalariifolium).

wfo-0001032512,"Solanum wightii is a beautiful, distinctive Indian endemic with large, zygomorphic flowers and berries enclosed in accrescent calyces that are borne on long, strongly deflexed pedicels. The only other species in India with purple zygomorphic flowers is S. pubescens which has sticky pubescence, smaller flowers with a single long stamen rather than three, and more fruit on each infructescence borne on shorter pedicels. The berry of S. wightii has been recorded as dry and dehiscent (breaks into four valves, Anon. s.n., in MH; described as “subcapsular” in Soosairaj et al. 2021) like members of the Androceras clade (Whalen 1979) and the Elaeagnifolium clade (see Knapp et al. 2017). Field studies of dispersal in S. wightii are needed; this type of dry berry is also found in members of the Leptostemonum Clade from Australia (Symon 1981; Martine et al. 2019) where dispersal can be either via a censer (shaking) mechanism or as trample burrs."
wfo-0001030959,"The long filiform inflorescences with a dense covering of long straight prickles on the rachis of S. ruvu have no parallels among the known Solanum species in Africa and Madagascar. The affinities of S. ruvu are most likely with S. zanzibarense, the only other scandent and sometimes subglabrous eastern African coastal forest species with subentire leaves, thin stems, and prickles that are sometimes straight. A similarly dense covering of long and flexible prickles/bristles is found on two other eastern African species that are not directly related to S. ruvu such as the savanna species S. setaceum in the Anguivi grade and the woody S. schumannianum in the Giganteum clade.
"
wfo-0001028805,"Solanum juninense is one of the few sticky-pubescent morelloids (with S. arenicola and S. subtusviolaceum) without an accrescent calyx. It is most similar to S. subtusviolaceum, and both can be distinguished from other glandular-pubescent species by their non-accrescent fruiting calyces and highly branched inflorescences. Solanum arenicola is a plant of the Amazonian foothills, while both S. juninense and S. subtusviolaceum are Andean taxa. Solanum juninense differs from S. subtusviolaceum in its plurifoliate sympodia with elliptic to narrowly elliptic leaves (versus unifoliate or difoliate sympodia with ovate to rhomboid leaves), acute to cuneate leaf base (versus truncate in S. subtusviolaceum), with shorter calyx lobes (1.5–2 mm long versus 2.5–3.5 mm long and sometimes toothed), slightly smaller corollas (1.2–1.5 cm in diameter versus 1.8–2 cm in diameter) with deltate rather than triangular lobes and one or two stone cells (versus four in S. subtusviolaceum) in each berry."
wfo-0001031095,"Solanum schefferi is a species with most of its distribution on the island of New Guinea, but several collections are from the Malaku islands and northern Sulawesi. Symon (1985) suggested this distribution and its distinct differences from other New Guinea species suggested it was an introduction from the Americas. Molecular phylogenetic study, however, shows that S. schefferi is clearly a member of the Eastern Hemisphere clade of spiny solanums (Aubriot et al. 2016a) and is member of a small monophyletic group containing S. athenae Symon and S. leptacanthum Merr. & L.M.Perry, both New Guinea endemics (but see below)."
wfo-0001025774,"Solanum africanum was recognised by Linnaeus as part of his S. dulcamara L. It is superficially similar to that species, but differs in its ellipsoid, rather than tapering, anthers (see Knapp 2013), its purple berries and in its strongly angled stems. It is sympatric with and could be confused with S. guineense, but the branched inflorescence with smaller flowers distinguish S. africanum. The fruits of S. guineense are orange when ripe. Leaf shape and pubescence vary a great deal throughout the range of S. africanum; plants from drier habitats near the sea appear to have fleshier leaves, but pubescence does not seem to be environmentally influenced. Juvenile leaves appear to have more deeply incised margins, but some flowering specimens also have incised leaves.
"
wfo-0001031877,"Solanum triquetrum, like most other members of the Dulcamaroid clade, has incredibly variable leaf morphology. Leaves vary from small, triangular in outline (hence the specific epithet meaning three -angled) and simple to quite deeply lobed at the base to very rarely pinnatifid with two or three pairs of lobes. Leaf size also varies a great deal, perhaps in response to moisture, some specimens with particularly large leaves appear to have been collected in wetter microhabitats. The only species in North America with which S. triquetrum could be confused is S. dulcamara, an introduced European taxon. Solanum triquetrum differs from S. dulcamara in its free anthers, more pointed leaves, strongly angled stems and smaller flowers. Both species have a green “eye”, often with shiny white margins, at the center of the corolla at the base of the stamens. Solanum triquetrum usually has white flowers, while S. dulcamara has purple flowers, but white-flowered plants of S. dulcamara occur throughout its range, both native and introduced. Like S. dulcamara, S. triquetrum arises from a subterreanean woody rootstock and may die back in winter or in particularly dry seasons. "
wfo-0001026205,"In Solanum anfractum, flower colour varies between white, cream, blue, violet, pale mauve, purple and magenta pink. It is not known whether this variation relates to age, as is common in other Solanum species (e.g., S. wendlandii of the New World). Etymology: The name refers to the slightly zigzag nature of the leading shoots (due to the sympodial growth pattern of this and all other Solanum species)."
wfo-0001029704,"Solanum multivenosum is known from very few collections in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, and is likely to occur in Irian Jaya as well; with the diploid (potential progenitor?) S. aviculare, it is the most tropical, mesic member of the Archaeosolanum clade. The strong, closely spaced venation and sparely pubescent leaves distinguish it from other members of the group, which generally have more spaced venation and are completely glabrous on mature leaves. Solanum multivenosum has the largest fruits in the Archaeosolanum group and the highest seed numbers. Crosses between Solanum multivenosum and other members of the Archaeosolanum clade have not been attempted to date (Symon, 1994)."
wfo-0001031843,"Solanum trichopetiolatum is a slender liana endemic to the Marojejy area of Antsiranana, with obovate leaves and pale violet flowers. The species is characterised primarily by its unusual pubescence of straight or curved simple 4-8-celled appressed or spreading trichomes 0.5-1.5 mm long on the petioles and sometimes on the young stems. Solanum trichopetiolatum is the only one of the several species morphologically similar to S. madagascariense described by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) that we consider distinct enough to merit species status. In addition to the indumentum described above, Solanum trichopetiolatum can be distinguished from the widespread S. madagascariense by its slender, loose inflorescences (Fig. 28 in Knapp and Vorontsova 2016) with usually fewer than 10 flowers (versus denser more robust inflorescences with more than 10 flowers), glabrous (versus glabrous to densely pubescent) corolla, and leaves that are more obovate and discolorous on herbarium specimens than is typical of S. madagascariense. Solanum trichopetiolatum differs from S. humblotii in its possession of a branched inflorescence with usually more than 10 flowers, rather than a few-flowered, unbranched inflorescence. It can also usually be distinguished by its calyx that is not lobed or has minute lobes to only 1 mm long (versus calyx lobes 3-4.5 mm long), but Birkinshaw 1281 from 2500 m elevation in Mahajanga has the distinctive trichomes of S. trichopetiolatum but has unusual filiform calyx lobes ca. 2 mm long. Although the plate of S. trichopetiolatum in D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) illustrates what appears to be a papillate anther, the protologue describes the anthers as smooth; all specimens we have seen have smooth, rather than papillate anthers. The part of Antsiranana surrounding mountain Marojejy has been identified by D'Arcy (1992) as an area of high diversity for wet forest Solanum. The overall aspect of Solanum trichopetiolatum on herbarium sheets is highly reminiscent of those specimens considered by D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) to belong to S. marojejy (here recognised as belonging to S. madagascariense), and leaves of the two species dry a similar dark golden-brown colour on herbarium sheets; the long trichomes and slender inflorescences of S. trichopetiolatum allow easy identification. Field and population studies are necessary to further understand the relationship between S. trichopetiolatum and S. madagascariense.

wfo-1000023515,"Commentary. Lycianthes rafatorresii is a Mexican endemic of the Caribbean slope of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. Morphologically, it is close to L. multiflora Bitter of Central America (which does not occur in Guatemala or Mexico), and it has been misidentified as L. sideroxyloides (Schltdl.) Bitter (with which it overlaps in distribution) and L. armentalis J.L.Gentry (with which it does not overlap) (Nee 1986). It differs from L. multiflora in having straight to curved rays on the trichomes (rather than crisped rays in L. multiflora), having the inflorescences and fruits on leafy stems that are not restricted to the last few terminal sympodial units of the plant (rather than having flowers and fruits on mostly leafless terminal sympodia so that they appear to be in a large panicle), having calyx appendages with a widened bulbous apex (rather than acute appendages), and having stellate corollas (rather than entire corollas). Lycianthes rafatorresii differs from L. sideroxyloides in lacking geminate-stellate trichomes, by having a corolla divided just half-way to the base (or less) with abundant interpetalar tissue (versus a deeply stellate corolla with scant interpetalar tissue), by having unequal stamens (versus equal stamens), and by having fewer, larger mature fruits (8-15 mm in diameter versus 2-7 mm in diameter in L. sideroxyloides). It differs from L. armentalis in lacking widely divaricate branching, having appendages with a widened bulbous apex (versus acute appendages), having more seeds per fruit (40-100 in L. rafatorresii versus 20-30 in L. armentalis), occurring at higher elevations (to 1600 m in L. rafatorresii versus to 500 m in L. armentalis), and not occurring in the lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula. More field study of L. rafatorresii is needed to better separate it from these similar species and understand its distribution, which currently does not appear to be continuous. Attempts by the author to locate this species in the field in Oaxaca in 2017 were unsuccessful.
"
wfo-0001022236,"Lycianthes beckneriana was described as a tree to 5 m tall on the type specimen label and original description, but this was probably in error, as all other collections say the plant is 1.5 to 2 m tall and a shrub to treelet. This species has morphological characters (such as equal stamens, simple trichomes, and purple corollas) and a habitat preference (high elevation cloud forest) similar to those of the species of Lycianthes series Piliferae, such as L. quichensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter (Dean et al. 2019).

"
wfo-0001031169,"Like Solanum artense Montroux, but differing in its high elevation serpentine substrate habitat, very fleshy, semi-succulent stems and leaves, glabrous petioles and larger berries.  Solanum artense is sparsely to densely pubescent on the stems, along the midvein of the leaves adaxially, and sometimes the inflorescence; its leaves are chartaceous and typically have a greater leaf length to width ratio than S. semisucculentum. Specimens of S. semisucculentum differ from the protologue of S. styraciflorum in petiole pubescence (glabrous or very sparsely pubescent versus densely stellate-subvillose), berry size (7.5–12.5 mm diameter versus ca. 6.0 mm) and elevational range (300–500 m versus 50 m). Solanum artense (incl. plants matching the protologue of S. styraciflorum) is found below 250 m on calcareous soils while S. semisucculentum is typically found at higher elevations, such as the plateau of the Dôme de Tiébaghi, at 300–500 m on lateritic soils. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of S. semisucculentum is its very fleshy, semisucculent leaves. Many species of Solanum wilt shortly after collecting; S. semisucculentum, however, appears well adapted for water deprivation."
wfo-0001028725,"Although the general aspect of Solanum jabrense, especially the yellow acicular prickles on the stems and leaves, suggests the S. polytrichum group of Whalen (1984), the form and size of the flowers and fruit, and the stellate-glandular, rusty pubescence clearly indicate that this species belongs to section Erythrotrichum (the S. erythrotrichum group of Whalen, 1984). Solanum jabrense differs from other species in the group in its recurved and non-accrescent calyx, leaves with acicular prickles that are persistent in adult plants and particular in the mixture of simple glandular trichomes of differing sizes and stellate trichomes with elongate glandular midpoints. The exact nature of the breeding system awaits study with living plants. This species was not treated in Agra (2004). Solanum jabrense is similar to S. megalonyx and S. cordifolium, but can be distinguished from those specis by its acicular prickles, recurved calyx and distinctive pubescence."
wfo-0001028736,"Solanum jamaicense is the most widespread of the species in sect. Micracantha and is a very common weed in pastures and roadsides in lowlands throughout the range of the section. While it can become scandent on other vegetation in weedy tangles, it is also the most shrublike species within sect. Micracantha. There are a number of characteristics of S. jamaicense that are unusual in the section. Although it is often scandent on other vegetation, S. jamaicense often has a more erect growth form that is uncommon in the section, which are normally vining. The rhombic leaves that nearly lack a petiole due to the decurrent leaf base are unique in the section. The flowers of S. jamaicense are among the smallest of the section and, although the anthers remain tightly connivent, the style is often bent at the apex. Additionally, S. jamaicense has small (4-12 mm in diameter), thin-skinned fruits that are mottled during development and calyx lobes with long-stalked stellate hairs. "
wfo-0001032354,"Solanum vescum shares green ripe fruit with S. symonii and S. capsiciforme and linear leaves with S. linearifolium, but is easily distinguished from other species in the Archaeosolanum clade by its strongly winged stems (from the sessile, decurrent leaves). Solanum vescum may be a parent, with another diploid species S. aviculare, of the tetraploid species S. laciniatum (Symon, 1994). These hypotheses remain to be tested with molecular techniques. Crosses with Solanum vescum have been successful with the diploid species S. aviculare, S. symonii and S. simile (summarized in Symon, 1994)."
wfo-0001026292,"Solanum arachnidanthum is somewhat geographically isolated within sect. Micracantha and occurs in the southernmost extent of the section's range in the Llanos de Moxos, a vast area of seasonally flooded savannas in the southwestern Amazon Basin in northern Bolivia and the adjacent Brazilian state of Rondonia. This seasonally flooded habitat is reminiscent of the periodically flooded swampy areas occupied by S. tampicense, a species found in Florida, the Caribbean, and Central America. Solanum arachnidanthum is one of the most easily recognizable species in sect. Micracantha. It has a festooning growth form with slender stems that drape over other vegetation and vicious recurved prickles that latch on to other plants. It is possible that it is spreads rhizomatously, as it forms dense stands where it occurs. The flowers are also distinct, with some of the longest anthers of the section (12-16 mm) that curve and spread upon anthesis. Phylogenetic results strongly support the sister relationship of S. arachnidanthum and S. tampicense and although the flowers of S. arachnidanthum are some of the largest in the section and those of S. tampicense are among the smallest, their festooning growth form, sparse pubescence, and small, thin-skinned fruits are very similar. The name for this species is derived from the Greek arachnid- meaning spider and -anthum meaning flower, referring to the long, thin corolla lobes and curving, spreading anthers.
"
wfo-0001027978,"Solanum flexicaule is only known from a small area in the lowlands of western Ecuador. This area has been heavily deforested and used for cultivation; this is a likely cause for the few collections of S. flexicaule (Dodson & Gentry 1991). Recent collections of S. flexicaule have been made near Cerro Samama in Los Rios Prov., Ecuador. A recent trip to Ecuador found much of this area under cultivation and was unsuccessful in locating S. flexicaule. Herbarium specimens of S. flexicaule have been annotated as S. volubile (or its synonym S. adhaerens). These species share many morphological characteristics, but S. flexicaule can be differentiated by its densely pubescent unlobed leaves and by its slightly smaller fruits and flowers as well as its disjunct distribution. The epithet is derived from the Latin flexi- meaning bending and -caule meaning stem and refers to the pliant stem of the species that is likely necessary for the its climbing, scrambling habit.
"
wfo-0001025656,"Solanum abutilifolium is very distinctive within section Erythrotrichum and at first glance can superficially look like a member of section Brevantherum due to its elliptic leaves, grey rather than red pubescence and lack of prickles on adult plants. The heterostylous flowers, branching and attenuate anthers all show it to clearly be a member of the Leptostemonum clade. As delimited here, this species can be distinguished from other members of the group by its ovate or elliptic leaves with tomentose or lanate grey to yellow pubescence of stellate trichomes with long midpoints to 6 mm. The inflorescences are open, with many visibly pedicellate flowers and the calyx and corolla are deeply lobed nearly to the base and the large, purple corolla, attaining 5 cm diameter, is the biggest in the Erythrotrichum group. Some specimens of Solanum abutilifolium have been identified as S. pycnanthemum, a species of southeastern Brazil (Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo). Solanum pycnanthemum has attenuate leaf bases, rusty or reddish brown pubescence of stellate non-glandular trichomes and a berry of ca. 1 cm diameter with a lanate pericarp with porrect stellate trichomes with filiform midpoints, while S. abutilifolium has non-decurrent leaf bases, glandular pubescence and a fruit to 2 cm in diameter with sticky, glandular pubescence. Dubs (1998) cited S. abutilifolium for Brazil, from Aquidauana, Mato Grosso, but the specimen cited (Hatschbach 30495) is of S. rhytidoandrum with odd flower and leaf morphology and a scabrous, rather than viscid, indumentum. Solanum abutilifolium does not show the striking differences in juvenile and adult foliage so common in other species of section Erythrotrichum, but juvenile leaves are slightly lobed marginally with a few prickles in the basal ¼ of the midrib. Rusby did not cite a herbarium in the protologue, but among the duplicates of Bang 373 in NY one is annotated in Rusby’s hand as “Solanum abutilifolium sp. nov.”, making this the holotype of the epithet. Several other names, unpublished, are written on other Bolivian collections, indicating perhaps tentative alternative epithets (all are nomina nuda)."
wfo-0001028046,"Solanum fulvidum can easily be recognised by the following suite of characters: difoliate sympodia, inflorescences opposite the leaves, dense, rusty-red pubescence and scabrous upper leaf surfaces with sessile to subsessile stellate trichomes with a long midpoint and reduced rays ca. ¼ the size of the midpoint. This species is similar to those of section Micracantha (the S. lanceifolium group of Whalen, 1984), where it perhaps belongs, but it’s erect to subscandent habit and glandular fruit pubescence seem to ally it with section Erythrotrichum. Testing of this relationship with molecular data is a priority."
wfo-0001030899,"Solanum rojasianum most closely resembles S. obliquum of the eastern Andean slope. Characters shared by the two species include expanded stigmas and short, broad anthers. Solanum rojasianum can be distinguished from S. obliquum by its puberulent fruits and few-flowered inflorescences, as well as its Mesoamerican distribution. Standley and Steyermark (1940), in their original description of this species, refer to it as being related to Cyphomandra costaricensis Donn. Sm. (= S. circinatum Bohs) of Central and northern South America. They erroneously describe the anthers of S. circinatum as being shorter than those of S. rojasianum, although their statement that S. circinatum has narrower buds and longer corollas is correct. Gentry and Standley’s assertion in the Flora of Guatemala (1974) that S. rojasianum is closely related to and possibly a variety of S. betaceum is incorrect, but S. rojasianum possibly belongs to the S. betaceum clade sensu Bohs (in press b). Solanum rojasianum and S. betaceum differ in their anther and gynoecium morphology, although they share some vegetative similarities in their velutinous pubescence and deeply cordate, chartaceous leaf blades."
wfo-0001030551,"Based on morphological characters, S. premnifolium belongs to the S. diploconos clade. Features it shares with other members of this clade include fleshy campanulate corollas, broad curved stamens with the connective abruptly constricted above the base, expanded styles, and puberulent fruits. Solanum premnifolium closely resembles S. latiflorum; in both species the stigmas, although broad, are not nearly as wide or abruptly expanded as those of S. diploconos or S. sciadostylis. Solanum premnifolium can be distinguished from S. latiflorum by its smaller calyx, narrower and more elongated style that is constricted at the apex, and the lack of an adaxially visible region of the anther connective. Solanum premnifolium is rather difficult to characterize morphologically because of the paucity of collections. This species apparently occurs in two disjunct localities, one in Paraná and the other in Rio de Janeiro, and these exhibit morphological differences. Specimens from Paraná are much less pubescent than those from Rio de Janeiro, lacking the dense long hairs on the leaves, stems, and inflorescence axes that characterize the northerly populations. Specimens from Paraná have much shorter pedicellar remnants (ca. 1 mm) than those from Rio (ca. 3-5 mm). Several collections from Paraná have immature fruits that are elongated with acute apices and no discernable stone cell aggregates. In contrast, one collection (Martinelli et al. 4138) from Rio has nearly mature fruits that are globose and obtuse with small stone cell aggregates. However, Miers 4538 from the Organ Mountains of Rio (the type of Pionandra pubescens Miers) shows characteristics more typical of the Paraná collections: short pedicellar remnants, nearly glabrous corollas, and elongated, pointed fruits. This collection also has smaller calyces (radius ca. 3 mm) than other accessions of S. premnifolium (calyx radius 4-7 mm). It is clear that more collections, especially of fruiting material, will shed much light on the critical characters of S. premnifolium. It is surprising that no collections have been seen from the intervening area in São Paulo. Only one specimen, Bowie & Cunningham s.n., has been purportedly collected from this state, but even this information is in doubt. Miers (1845) reports that this specimen was collected in São Paulo, but the sheet itself includes no locality information. The occurrence of this species in Bahia is also questionable. The Lockhart specimens at BM were supposedly collected there, but no additional locality information is available. Although no etymology for the specific epithet was given, it is assumed that the name is derived from Premna, a genus in the Verbenaceae, and “folium,” or leaf. The correct compounding form should be “premnifolium.” This is treated as an orthographic error (Art. 73.8 of the ICBN) and automatically corrected."
wfo-0001030160,"Solanum pachyneuroides is superficially similar to S. pachyneurum, with coriaceous leaves and prickly stems. The trichomes of the two species are markedly different, those of S. pachyneurum are sessile, somewhat lepidote and many-rayed, while those of S. pachyneuroides are stalked and only ever have 2-4 rays. Solanum pachyneuroides has fewer pairs of veins, and appears to have larger fruit. The winged pedicel seen in fruiting specimens is also distinctive, but flowering specimens of female plants have not been seen. The thick coriaceous leaves of S. pachyneuroides are also like those of S. gundlachii, another Cuban endemic, but that species has elongate, rather than short, inflorescences. The extremely rare and sympatric S. moense also resembles this suite of taxa, but it has denser, reddish rusty, long-stalked pubescence. Solanum pachyneuroides appears to be dioecious, with different individual plants bearing markedly different types of inflorescences (as is seen in other dioecious species of Solanum such as S. polygamum, S. crotonoides and a number of Australian species). The isotype specimen of S. pachyneuroides at US is apparently a male plant, with branched inflorescences, while Wright 382 p.p. at K (an isotype of S. pachyneurum var. glabrescens) is a female, with an inflorescence (in fruit) consisting of a single flower arising from the stem. Amshoff (1954) also observed that the calyx in female flowers was pricklier than in male flowers, supporting his separation of S. pachyneuroides from S. pachyneurum where he observed no difference in what were previously said to be long- and short-styled flowers of the latter species. In eastern Cuba, Solanum pachyneuroides is sympatric and easily confused with S. gundlachii, but the distinctive few-rayed large stellate trichomes of S. pachyneuroides are diagnostic. Inflorescences of S. gundlachii have both long- and short-styled flowers, but fruiting specimens are difficult to distinguish if care is not taken to observe trichomes. "
wfo-0001028273,"Solanum gundlachii is a distinctive species with holly-like, prickly leaves and long, terminal inflorescences. The leaves are similar to those of S.chamaeacanthum, also of Cuba, but that species is a creeping herb or subshrub with stellate trichomes with fewer rays. These two species may also be related to S. schulzianum and S. selleanum of Hispaniola, both of which also have densely prickly foliage, holly-like (or larger) leaves and often elongate inflorescences.

wfo-0001028525,"Solanum imamense is a fairly common liana or shrub with shallowly cordate or truncate leaves clustered towards tips of branches, large (to 3 cm in diameter) violet or purple flowers, and large anthers 4-5 mm long. The pubescence of dendritic trichomes up to 0.3-0.5 mm long is visible with the naked eye on the petioles, pedicels, inflorescences and abaxial sides of the leaves. Solanum imamense is morphologically similar and possibly closely related to S. betroka from southern Madagascar and S. sambiranense from northern Madagascar, and perhaps also the rare and poorly known S. ivohibe from the province of Fianarantsoa. Solanum imamense differs from S. betroka in its inflorescences with 7-13 (versus 1-3) flowers, larger floral parts, and leaves that are always entire (versus leaves that are frequently lobed). Solanum imamense can be distinguished from S. sambiranense by its ovate leaves 2.5-5 cm long (versus elliptic to obovate leaves 5-10 cm long) and looser dendritic trichomes 0.2-0.5 mm (versus less than 0.1 mm) long. Solanum imamense differs from S. ivohibe by its ovate leaves less than 5 cm long (versus elliptic to obovate leaves 5-7 cm long), cordate to short attenuate (versus long attenuate) leaf base, and calyx lobes more than 2 mm (versus less than 2 mm) long. Solanum imamense has a broad ecological profile occurring occasionally in dry to mesic parts of the island in the western, central, and southern ecoregions (Humbert 1955; Faramalala 1988, 1995). In the southern part of its distribution range it is sympatric with S. betroka and in the northern part of the range with S. sambiranense."
wfo-0001026535,"Solanum betroka is a spindly shrub or liana endemic to southern Madagascar. It has small membranous lobed leaves with prominent finer venation clustered on the tips of branches, no more than 3 flowers per inflorescence, and no tufts of trichomes in the axils of the major leaf veins on leaf undersides (domatia). It is the only species of Solanum endemic to Madagascar not a member of the Leptostemonum clade to commonly exhibit lobed leaves (Fig. 5) on reproductive stems; lobed leaves in S. madagascariense occasionally occur but are rare. Solanum betroka can be difficult to distinguish from the very similar and possibly closely related S. sambiranense and S. imamense. It differs from S. sambiranense by its ovate to elliptic (versus elliptic to obovate) leaves under 5 cm (versus over 5 cm) long, with cuneate to truncate (versus attenuate) bases, inflorescences with 1-3 (versus 3-10) flowers, and calyx lobes 2-3 mm (versus 4-6 mm) long. Solanum betroka bears a strong resemblance to S. sambiranense: both have a clearly visible brown fine venation network, membranous glabrescent leaves that dry greenish brown, and a similar habit. Typical representatives of the southern S. betroka and northern S. sambiranense are clearly distinct but specimens from the centre of Madagascar are more difficult to determine. Further sampling may prove that these two taxa are in fact conspecific. Solanum betroka can be distinguished from S. imamense by its inflorescences with 1-3 (versus 7-13) flowers, flowers under 2 cm (versus over 2 cm) in diameter, and anthers 3.5-5 mm (versus 4-5 mm) long. Solanum betroka has also been confused with without prickles specimens of the spiny solanums S. batoides D'Arcy & Rakot. and S. erythracanthum Dunal; these can be distinguished easily based on pubescence and anther morphology. Solanum betroka has dendritic trichomes and ellipsoid anthers while S. batoides and S. erythracanthum have the stellate trichomes and long-tapered anthers typical of members of the Leptostemonum clade (Vorontsova et al. 2013; Vorontsova and Knapp 2016). Solanum betroka occurs primarily in the unique arid southern ecoregion of Madagascar, with a few records further north in the somewhat wetter western ecoregion (Humbert 1955; Faramalala 1988, 1995). It is the only member of the African non-spiny clade restricted to such severely dry climate, although a few spiny Solanum species also occur in the area: Solanum batoides, S. bumeliifolium Dunal, S. croatii D'Arcy & R.C.Keating, and S. heinianum D'Arcy & R.C.Keating; the related S, imamense is partly sympatric with S. betroka in the wetter more northern parts of its distribution range. The habitat niche of S. betroka is significantly different from that of S. imamense and S. sambiranenese both of which occur in wetter habitats further north."
wfo-0001030225,"Solanum paralum is closely allied to S. sycocarpum, both from coastal mountain ranges of southeastern Brazil. Both species have succulent stems, leaves, and flowers and both have the anther connective extended abaxially beyond the apices of the thecae. Solanum paralum differs from S. sycocarpum in having puberulent leaves and stems and pinnately compound rather than entire to pinnately lobed leaves. There is little information about the range or habitat preferences of S. paralum; it is presently known only from less than ten collections. Efforts should be made to locate other populations of this species, and field observations are needed to clarify the relationship of S. paralum to the nearly sympatric and morphologically very similar S. sycocarpum. The pinnately compound leaves and seaside habitat of S. paralum are reminiscent of S. pelagicum Bohs, but S. paralum differs in its floral structure and lack of dendritic pubescence. Solanum pelagicum belongs to Solanum section Cyphomandropsis and has no obvious relationship with S. paralum.
"
wfo-0001028551,"Symon (1985) in the original protologue stated that the name referred to the hoary pubescence of the buds.
"
wfo-0001030784,"Like Solanum pseudopedunculatum D.McClelland but differing in shorter stature, densely glandular new growth, stellate trichomes with elongate midpoints that sometimes lack rays, smaller flowers and smaller, few-seeded fruits. Very little is known about S. ratale due to the few collections in herbaria. It is most similar to S. pseudopedunculatum but can be distinguished by its shorter habit, occasionally prickly individuals, shorter pedicels, and smaller corolla, anthers, and fruit. Solanum ratale is polymorphic for presence of prickles on all parts, as is found in many other spiny solanums, both in the Old and New World (e.g., S. elaeagnifolium Cav., see Knapp et al. 2017; S. setaceum Dammer and S. schumannianum Dammer, see Vorontsova and Knapp 2016). The collection Smith 5370 from Viti Levu is densely prickly, but otherwise conforms exactly to the other collections of S. ratale. This collection has been identified in herbaria as S. retrorsum Elmer, a Philippine species with a similar polymorphism in the possession of retrorse prickles, but differing in its plurifoliate sympodial units, larger trichomes with midpoints equal to the rays, and bright red berry."
wfo-0001027260,"This species is widespread in the humid forsets of southeastern Brazil and adjacent Argentina and is a characteristic element in the understory of Araucaria stands. It can be distinguished from other species in the Cyphomandra clade by its large, deeply cordate leaves, abundant pubescence, branched inflorescences, white or purple stellate corollas somewhat pubescent abaxially and glabrous adaxially, relatively short and broad anthers, cylindrical styles, and densely pubescent fruits. It most closely resembles S. pinetorum, also from southern Brazil. Both species have abundant pubescence on the stems and leaves, purple stellate corollas, and pubescent fruits. Solanum corymbiflorum can be distinguished from S. pinetorum by the abruptly tapered anther connectives in the former. Two subspecies can be recognised within S. corymbiflorum based on peduncle length and corolla size, but future studies may show that subsp. mortonianum is simply a local large-flowered variant of S. corymbiflorum that does not merit taxonomic recognition. Subspecies corymbiflorum occurs in Araucaria forest, whereas subsp. mortonianum occurs in cloud forest at higher elevations. Subspecies corymbiflorum has peduncles shorter than 7 cm and corolla radius less than 15 mm with lobes less than 11 mm long (if corollas large, then peduncles short), while subspecies mortonianum has peduncles 7 cm or longer and corolla radius 15 mm or more, the lobes 15 mm or longer.

"
wfo-0001027262,"This subspecies is separated from subsp. corymbiflorum by its larger corollas and longer peduncles. Those specimens with a corolla radius greater than 15 mm, corolla lobes longer than 11 mm, and a peduncle equal to or greater than 7 cm long probably belong to subsp. mortonianum. Collections of this subspecies also have elongated acute fruits. The two collections of subsp. mortonianum from Paraná, Hatschbach 1593 and 11922, differ from the other representatives of this taxon in having smaller calyces and pubescent anthers. Although the anther pubescence is unique in the Cyphomandra clade and the collections are geographically separated from the rest of the subspecies, they are probably best regarded as local variants of subsp. mortonianum. Cyphomandra patrum was segregated from C. mortoniana by Smith and Downs (1964) because of its longer and denser indumentum, but indumentum varies considerably within subsp. mortonianum and in S. corymbiflorum as a whole and is not sufficiently distinctive in C. patrum to justify its recognition as a separate species.

"
wfo-0001027261,"Great morphological variability is present within this taxon, particularly in pubescence, calyx size and shape, corolla size, and fruit shape. Specimens vary from being nearly glabrous to densely pubescent or pilose. All intermediate states of pubescence can be found on herbarium material, so it is impossible to distinguish distinct taxonomic entities based on pubescence characters, as Smith and Downs (1966) attempted to do. The calyx lobes vary from broad to long and narrow, and the corolla diameters range from about 10 mm (in the type of C. macrophylla) to around 30 mm. Again, intermediate sizes and shapes are present. The element segregated by Smith and Downs as C. macrophylla is somewhat distinct in having very small flowers, generally large leaves, and elongated, acute fruits. Unfortunately, the only fruits available are very young, and fruits are lacking on most other specimens that have very small corollas. Large leaves are not unique to C. macrophylla and occur in many collections of S. corymbiflorum. Therefore, C. macrophylla has not been maintained as a discrete taxon.
"
wfo-0001030420,"This Brazilian species shares the following features with S. cacosmum and S. corymbiflorum: pubescent leaves with cordate bases, truncate stigmas, slender cylindrical styles, and hairy fruits. Solanum pinetorum can be distinguished from S. cacosmum by its relatively broad connective regions that does not extend abaxially below the anther thecae and is not expanded adaxially, its more elongate fruits with longer hairs, and its purple rather than green corolla. Solanum pinetorum is restricted to southeastern Brazil, whereas S. cacosmum is found mainly in the western Amazon. The morphological similarities between these two species are not indicative of a particularly close phylogenetic relationship, although both S. pinetorum and S. cacosmum belong to the S. diploconos clade based on ITS sequence data (Bohs, in press b). Solanum pinetorum is more closely related to S. corymbiflorum, also of southeastern Brazil. It differs from S. corymbiflorum in its more shallowly cordate leaves with shorter basal lobes, its longer and narrower anthers with a relatively broad connective region, and its elongated and pointed fruits. The inflorescences of S. pinetorum are usually unbranched and few-flowered, unlike the branched and many-flowered inflorescences of S. corymbiflorum. Smith and Downs (1966) recognized three species, based mainly on differences in pubescence and leaf size and shape, whereas only one species is recognized here. Pubescence and leaf size vary considerably within S. pinetorum (the occurrence and density of longer eglandular hairs is especially variable) and the criteria used by Smith and Downs (1966) for distinguishing these species do not hold up when the entire range of collections is examined. Solanum pinetorum, as circumscribed here, has a disjunct distribution, with populations in the northern area in the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo separated from those of the southern area by about 250 km. The northern populations typically have larger leaves and corollas than those from the southern regions. The element segregated as Cyphomandra angustifolia Smith & Downs occupies the north central parts of the province of Santa Catarina and includes the collections Smith & Reitz 8736, Smith & Klein 8416, Reitz & Klein 11710, and Reitz & Klein 11391. These collections have smaller and relatively narrower leaves, narrower corolla lobes, and shorter, narrower anthers with a smaller and less prominent connective region than other collections of S. pinetorum, but do not seem to be sufficiently different to justify taxonomic recognition."
wfo-0001028944,"Solanum lanceolatum is a variable species and extends from Mexico through Central America but not into South America. It is easily recognized among the Central American Solanum species by the dense white tomentum on the stems and leaf undersides and by the large blue or purple flowers in open inflorescences. Leaf size and shape is highly variable, but when a series of herbarium specimens or living plants are seen in the field, it is evident that only one species is involved. The vigorous leaves on young plants and stump sprouts are large, deeply lobed, and spiny, whereas those from flowering branches are smaller and often entire and without prickles. The phenotypic variability responsible for the creation of so many synonyms can be observed on a single plant. The populations from the arid plateau and valleys of the Mexican states of Puebla and Oaxaca and a few adjacent areas are more delicate with a tendency toward consistently narrow and thin leaves. The type of S. lanceolatum is from a plant of this sort and it seems to be the predominant form grown in European botanical gardens in the 1800's. A few collections from near Maltrata and Acultzingo near the Puebla border approach these, whereas the other Mexican collections are mostly of the more robust and widespread form. Taxonomic recognition of these collections at the specific or varietal level does not seem to be warranted at present.
"
wfo-0001028984,"Solanum latiflorum is distinguished from all other species in Solanum section Pachyphylla by its exclusively simple leaves, very large calyces, short broad stamens, expanded styles and stigmas, and elongated puberulent fruits. Its fleshy campanulate corolla, short, broad, curved stamens with the connective abruptly narrowed above the base, expanded style and stigma, and puberulent fruits are characters shared with S. diploconos, S. sciadostylis, and S. premnifolium, all from southeastern Brazil. The style of S. latiflorum is not nearly as broadly and abruptly expanded as in S. diploconos and S. sciadostylis. Solanum latiflorum differs from S. premnifolium by having larger calyces, broader and shorter styles, and adaxially swollen anther connectives. The very large calyx and elongated fruits of S. latiflorum resemble those of some Venezuelan collections of S. diversifolium, but a close relationship between the two species is not supported by other morphological characters or by molecular data."
wfo-0001027238,"Solanum cordovense can be recognized by its combination of stellate hairs, no spines, very short peduncles, foliaceous calyx lobes, and dark purple to black fruits. Most collections of S. cordovense from elevations of 1000 m or more have leaves with the upper surfaces sparsely pubescent to glabrescent. Plants with dense pubescence on all parts, including the upper leaf surfaces, have been segregated as S. extensum. These collections generally have a more scandent habit, possess stellate hairs with very long, often gland-tipped midpoints, and occur below ca. 1000 m in elevation. Further study may reveal that S. cordovense and S. extensum comprise two distinct species, but they are combined here due to their lack of consistent morphological or geographical distinctions. In S. perattenuatum the leaf blades are very long and narrow (length to width ratio 5-10 or more), with elongated attenuate apices. Otherwise, the pubescence, flowers, and fruits resemble those of S. cordovense. It is likely that these collections represent virally-infected individuals of S. cordovense.
"
wfo-1000024767,"The species is morphologically similar to Solanum luridifuscescens from which it differs by its greyish beige bark (vs. greenish brown), usually boat-shaped leaves, drying black (vs. flat, drying brown), branched cymes (vs. unbranched), swollen calyx, with lobes 1–1.5 mm long (vs. weakly or nonswollen calyx, with lobes 1.5–2 mm long), and anthers 5.2–5.7 mm in length, sessile (vs. 6.5–9.5 mm, filaments conspicuous). The specific epithet come from the latin words confertus (crowded) and florus (flor), a reference to the congested flowers at the apex of the inflorescence."
wfo-0001030492,"Solanum pluviale is most similar to and sometimes included within S. chrysotrichum. Similarities include large, coarsely lobed leaves, broad-based prickles, ferruginous pubescence, and a high elevation habitat. However, S. pluviale differs from S. chrysotrichum in having glabrate stems and sparser leaf hairs, these often with 4 lateral rays. Most specimens have eglandular pubescence on the inflorescence axes, but occasionally the pedicels can be sparsely glandular. Some collectors have mentioned that the stems, petioles, and leaf undersides are purple. Solanum pluviale occurs at scattered mid- to high-elevation localities around Costa Rica: at Monteverde, near Volcán Poás, at Tapantí Reserve, and on the Atlantic slope of the Cordillera de Talamanca. In most of these areas it is sympatric with S. chrysotrichum. It also occurs in high-elevation areas of adjacent Panama."
wfo-0001031114,"This species is distinctive due to its highly discolorous leaves, which are dark green above and bright white below due to a dense tomentum of stellate hairs. The highly discolorous leaves of this species are similar to those of S. lepidotum, but in S. lepidotum the whitish pubescence is formed by peltate or peltate-stellate hairs with a fused central portion, whereas in S. schlechtendalianum it is composed exclusively of stellate hairs. Nee (M. Nee, pers. comm.) notes that in S. schlechtendalianum the inflorescence is more or less hidden under the associated major leaf. The flowers are nodding, but the ripe purple fruits are held erect under the leaf and more or less in contact with the lower surface, thus hidden from sight when looking at the plant from above. Perhaps this serves as a mechanism to hide the mature fruits from bats during the night and encourage dispersal by birds during the day (Nee, 1993)."
wfo-0001030000,"Solanum obliquum has characters found in several members of the S. betaceum clade: very broad stigmas with two apical glands, short anthers with the connective not prolonged below the bases of the anther thecae, and stellate, coriaceous corollas with relatively broad and spreading lobes. It is most similar to S. zumbense, also from the eastern slope of the Andes, but differs in lacking abundant long hairs on the foliage and axes, and in its usually greenish and puberulent corollas, glabrous fruits with obtuse apices, and relatively short filaments. Collections of S. zumbense were originally noted as anomalous specimens of S. obliquum in the treatment of Bohs (1994), but were later described as a separate species (Stern & Bohs, 2009). Solanum obliquum is also similar to S. rojasianum from Central America, but can be distinguished by its glabrous fruits, longer inflorescences, and South American distribution. Solanum obliquum also resembles S. unilobum from southern Peru and Bolivia, but can be distinguished from the latter species by its deeply cordate leaves with oblique bases, inflorescences with very short and nearly contiguous pedicel scars, and abundant fine puberulence.
"
wfo-0001030299,"This species may be readily recognized by its densely tomentose, campanulate-urceolate corolla and by its usually pinnately divided leaves. The most distal pair of leaflets is often basiscopically decurrent along the rachis for 1 cm or more. Specimens with ternate and simple leaves also occur. Solanum pendulum closely resembles S. diversifolium and molecular data hint at a relationship between these species. Both have pinnately compound leaves and similar anthers and gynoecia, although the flower parts of S. pendulum are larger than those of S. diversifolium and S. diversifolium corollas lack the dense tomentum of S. pendulum. Densely tomentose corollas are also found in S. exiguum and the ranges of S. pendulum and S. exiguum overlap in Bolivia. Molecular data, however, argue against a close relationship between the two species. Solanum pendulum can be distinguished from S. exiguum by the long corolla tubes and glabrous fruits in the former species. Solanum pendulum may be closely related to Solanum viridiflorum Ruiz & Pavón, as pointed out by Ruiz and Pavón in the original description of the two species. From their illustrations in the Flora Peruviana (1799), the two species differ in that S. viridiflorum has entire leaves and villous fruits whereas S. pendulum has ternate or pinnate leaves and glabrous fruits. Because pinnate, ternate, and simple leaves can be found on a single plant of S. pendulum, leaf shape may not be a reliable character differentiating the two taxa. This illustrations also indicate that S. viridiflorum is pubescent on the leaves and stems and S. pendulum is not, but the description accompanying S. pendulum refers to it as being hirsute or pubescent. It is possible that S. viridiflorum is conspecific with S. cajanumense (q.v.), but without type specimens the identity of S. viridiflorum cannot be ascertained, and S. viridiflorum is currently considered a species of unknown placement."
wfo-0001027900,"Within Solanum section Crinitum, Solanum falciforme most closely resembles Solanum lycocarpum A. St.-Hil., Solanum gomphodes Dunal and Solanum crinitum Lam. All four species have pubescence of sessile to short-stalked porrect-stellate hairs and distributions centered in eastern Brazil. Solanum gomphodes can be easily distinguished from Solanum falciforme by its sessile leaves (vs. petioles usually 3-5 cm long in Solanum falciforme) and exclusively short-stalked stellate hairs. Solanum lycocarpum and Solanum crinitum are sympatric with Solanum falciforme, but the former two species have much broader distributions throughout South America. Solanum falciforme is easily distinguished from S. lycocarpum and S. crinitum by the presence of macroscopic falcate (sickle-shaped) long-stalked bristly hairs on the young stems as well as the inflorescence and calyx. Collections of Solanum crinitum often have similar long-stalked trichomes on the young stems, inflorescence and calyx; however the stalks of these hairs are straight. Solanum lycocarpum is similar to the other three taxa in its abundant pubescence of short-stalked stellate hairs, but the distinctive long-stalked hairs found in Solanum falciforme are noticeably absent.
"
wfo-0001032595,"Within the Cyphomandra clade, S. zumbense is most similar to S. obliquum. Both species have very broad stigmas with two apical glands, short anthers with the connective not prolonged below the bases of the anther thecae, and stellate, coriaceous corollas with relatively broad and spreading lobes. Solanum zumbense differs from S. obliquum in having abundant long hairs on the foliage and axes, pointed and often pubescent fruits, and purplish, nearly glabrous corollas. The filaments are quite long and are a distinctive feature. Solanum zumbense is found at higher elevations (above 1500 m) than typical plants of S. obliquum. Solanum zumbense takes its name from the town of Zumba in southern Ecuador near the Peruvian border, where the type collection was made. Although this locality is in the northern extremity of the range of this species, the euphonious epithet was too good to pass up. Zumbar is also the Spanish word for buzz, a common pollination mechanism in many species of Solanum.
"
wfo-0001031896,"Solanum truncatum is very similar to and possibly not distinct from S. torvum. Both taxa have glandular pubescence on the inflorescence axes, but that of S. torvum is less dense and composed of longer, more obvious unbranched glandular hairs. Solanum truncatum is generally found at higher elevations and more inland locations than S. torvum. The ferruginous pubsecence combined with glandular inflorescence hairs suggests that this “species” may be the product of hybridization between S. torvum and S. chrysotrichum. It is possible that S. truncatum is conspecific with S. stellatiglandulosum Bitter from South America, in which case the latter name has priority. However, the isotype of S. stellatiglandulosum examined at NY has glandular stellae on the stems and inflorescence axes, whereas Central American material has eglandular stem and glandular infloresence hairs."
wfo-0001031609,"This species is one of the most unusual in Solanum section Pachyphylla. It is a small tree of the seacoast with succulent stems, leaves, and flowers. The leaf-opposed inflorescences resemble those of Solanum section Geminata. The inflorescence axis is shorter than other species in the Cyphomandra clade and the small, obovate fruits are atypical in the group. These fruits are said to resemble small figs, hence the name “sycocarpum” or “fig-like fruit.” In floral features, however, this species conforms to section Pachyphylla. The anther connective is obvious and discrete and is prolonged beyond the apices of the anther thecae as a rostrate or beaked structure similar to that of S. paralum. Three collections from the area around Rio de Janeiro have pinnately lobed leaves, in contrast to the elliptic or obovate leaves of the more northerly collections. Sendtner (1846) considered the plants with lobed leaves as a separate species, Cyphomandra lobata Sendtn., but mentioned that it might be better regarded as a variety of S. sycocarpum. Because both lobed and unlobed leaves may be present on a single plant (e.g., Sucre et al. 9542) and because flowers of both segregates are similar in all respects, they are here regarded as conspecific. Further field work is needed to ascertain whether the differences in leaf morphology are consistent with geographical location. "
wfo-0001027380,"The absence of type material for both the species name and one of the synonyms has made recognition of the few collections difficult. Solanum cremastocarpum was recognized as a synonym by Bitter, but he then proceeded to name S. dolichopodum which seems to differ in little more than the shorter peduncle and absence of pubescence. However a number of New Guinea species are sparsely pubescent only on young tips and are glabrescent with age. It is possible that S. dolichopodum is the older name for Symon's New Guinea species S. incanoalabastrum, but the few flowers, slender elongate pedicels and broader leaves seem to be distinct characters of the latter species.
"
wfo-0001027720,"Solanum dunalianum is morphologically similar to S. viridifolium, but S. dunalianum in Australia has young leaves and petioles with stellate hairs (vs. glabrous for S. viridifolium); petioles 7-10% of lamina length (vs. 15-30% for S. viridifolium); common peduncle 5-8 mm long (vs. 12-23 mm long for S. viridifolium); pedicels and calyx densely to very densely stellate hairy (vs. glabrous or sparsely stellate-hairy); central ray of stellae deflexed (vs. erect) and style 7-8 mm long (vs. 4.5-5.5 mm for S. viridifolium). There are two sheets of S. dunalianum at P that were collected by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré. The sheet with 5 leaves and the prickly stem, with the label saying ""Solanum dunalianum, Aquartia Dl, Ile Pisang, C.G."" was chosen as lectotype by Bean (2004), as that specimen more closely matched the protologue. Bean (2004) was uncertain about the correct application of the name S. dunalianum. The Australian species is perhaps referable to S. torricellense Bitter, but further taxonomic study is required. Symon (1985) states that this species appears closely related to S. torricellense, from which it is not always readily separated; it is less closely related to S. mankiense. From the first it may be separated by its larger berries, slightly different pubescence, and generally larger leaves; from S. mankiense it is differentiated by its larger leaves, sparser pubescence, and greater stature. Solanum dunalianum was named by the French naturalist Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré (1789-1854) for Michel Félix Dunal (1789-1856) a French Solanologist at Montpelier."
wfo-0001031752,"Solanum tobagense is similar to S. fortunense in its truncate to subcordate leaf bases, tomentose to ciliate corolla margins, and acute fruits. The puberulent fruits of S. tobagense distinguish it from S. fortunense. In addition, the leaves of S. fortunense are larger and more coriaceous than those of S. tobagense, and S. fortunense is found in Central America, whereas S. tobagense is a species of northern South America. Solanum tobagense is also similar to S. circinatum and was originally thought to belong to the S. circinatum group (Bohs, 1994), but molecular data place it in a clade with S. diversifolium, S. pendulum, and S. oxyphyllum. Solanum tobagense can be distinguished from S. circinatum by its exclusively unlobed leaves with truncate to subcordate bases and its puberulent, acute fruits. It shares few characters with S. diversifolium, although molecular ITS data place it as sister to S. diversifolium with high bootstrap support. The phylogenetic placement of S. tobagense should be investigated further with additional genes, as a close relationship with S. diversifolium as well as S. pendulum and S. oxyphyllum is unexpected from a morphological perspective. Solanum tobagense has a disjunct distribution separated by the Orinoco delta. Some populations are found in northeastern coastal Venezuela and Tobago and a second area of distribution occurs in inland areas of eastern Venezuela and Guyana. Some morphological differentiation appears to have taken place between the two areas. Steyermark & Nilsson 183 and Steyermark & Dunsterville 104421, both from Estado Bolívar, Venezuela, have much denser and longer hairs on the lower leaf surfaces than any of the other collections. In general, the specimens from Estado Bolívar, Venezuela, and adjacent Guyana have longer inflorescences than those from Tobago and coastal Venezuela. Steyermark (1979, 1982) gives examples of other plant taxa showing disjunct distributions between coastal Venezuela and lowland forests to the south."
wfo-0001026923,"Solanum celsum has been considered a synonym of S. lepidotum, but the two entities appear to show some differences. The trichomes of S. celsum are intermediate between stellate hairs and peltate scales, with the central fused part of the lateral rays smaller than in S. lepidotum. Pubescence of the leaf undersides is sparser in S. celsum than in S. lepidotum so that that the mesophyll is visible between the hairs. Unlike S. lepidotum and S. schlechtendalianum, the leaf surfaces of S. celsum are not strongly discolorous (green adaxially and white abaxially). 
"
wfo-0001032248,"Solanum urens is a striking plant, known only from a very few collections from the older volcanoes on St. Vincent. It appears not to have been collected on the active volcano of Soufriere at the northern end of the island, but rather on older rocks to the south. It is morphologically similar (but much larger than) S. schulzianum, of Hispaniola, and S. gundlachii of Cuba and Hispaniola. Solanum urens can be distinguished from both those species by its complex, branched inflorescences, very large, pale purple flowers, and dense pubescence of a mixture of long-stalked and sessile stellate trichomes. "
wfo-0001028250,"Morphologically, S. guamense is similar to S. sandwicense and S. amicorum. It can easily be distinguished from S. sandwicense by its totally white corollas, straight anthers with restricted pores, and small fruit. From S. amicorum it can be distinguished by its poricidal dehiscence, small, black fruits and the distinctive pubescence of veins of the abaxial surface of the leaves of S. amicorum.
"
wfo-0001025888,"Solanum amicorum is easily recognized by its large, deltate to ovate leaves with the pubescence of the veins on the abaxial leaf surface distinct from the pubescence of the rest of the blade. It is most similar S. sandwicense but differs by its more compact inflorescence, longitudinally dehiscent anthers, and orange-red to red fruits. The name of this species is literally the Solanum of friends. Presumable the epithet refers to the origin of the species in Tonga, previously known as the Friendly Islands.
"
wfo-0001030115,"Solanum orthacanthum is a striking plant with its strongly discolorous leaves and large, bright purple flowers. It is not easily confused with any other Solanum on Hispaniola. In his original description of S. orthacanthum, Schulz (1913) indicated the species was morphologically similar to S. lanceolatum Cav. (called by him S. laurifolium Miller). Solanum laanceolatum is a species of Mexico and Central America which has similar discolorous leaves, but has porrect, stellate trichomes with ca. 10 rays rather than echinoid stellate trichomes with many rays indistinguishable from the midpoint."
wfo-0001029488,"Like Solanum semisucculentum D.McClelland, but growing in the forest, a taller plant and with pubescent stems, leaves, and inflorescences. Solanum memaoyanum is most similar to another new species described here, S. semisucculentum. Specimens here attributed to both were included in Heine’s (1976) concept of S. styraciflorum Schltr.; McClelland (2012) treats S. styraciflorum as a synonym of S. artense Montroux (see description of S. artense on Solanaceae Source, www.solanaceaesource.org). From herbarium material S. memayoanum appears to have fleshy leaves like S. semisucculentum, but it differs in having a taller habit (MacKee 21797 records the stems as being 8 cm in diameter), pubescent stems, leaves, and inflorescences, and seeds with a more deeply pitted (the lateral cell walls longer) surface. In addition, the habitat of the two species differs; Solanum memaoyanum grows in closed rainforest from 1,300 to 1,500 m elevation as opposed to S. semisucculentum, which grows in open shrubby habitat (maquis) and is typically not found above 700 m elevation. Solanum artense (incl. plants matching the protologue of S. styraciflorum) is found below 250 m on calcareous soils, rather than the serpentine soils in mountainous regions on which both S. memaoyanum and S. semisucculentum are found."
wfo-0001026503,"It is rare for a plant species to be known to be extinct. Unfortunately, S. bauerianum holds this dubious distinction and is one of only two species of plants from Lord Howe Island to have become extinct (Auld & Hutton, 2004; Hutton et al., 2007). Solanum bauerianum was last collected on Lord Howe Island in 1937 and on Norfolk Island in 1830 (Green, 1994). The likely cause of the extinction of S. bauerianum on Lord Howe Island was the introduction of rats in 1918 from the vessel Makambo (Auld & Hutton, 2004; Paramonov, 1960). Rats are seed predators and have heavily impacted species in Solanum section Irenosolanum on other islands, most notably the Hawaiian Islands. Besides its anthropological interest, S. bauerianum is notable because of its lack of stellate hairs. This species is one of two in section Irenosolanum that lack stellate hairs the other being S. nudatum. While S. nudatum bears no hairs, S. bauerianum has simple hairs, flexed at the base and directed distally on the corolla abaxially as well as the typical minute glandular hairs of section Irenosolanum on the stems, leaves, inflorescence, and flowers. The simple nonglandular hairs are likely reduced stellate hairs and are unique in section Irenosolanum. Solanum bauerianum is resembles S. viride superficially. However, S. bauerianum can be differentiated easily by its showy inflorescences and unusual pubescence on the abaxial surface of the corolla. This species was named to honor Ferdinand Bauer (1760-1826), the Austrian botanical illustrator.

wfo-0001027503,"Solanum dendroicum is a very distinctive species with its shiny leaf uppersides and densely echinoid pubescent undersides that are pale tan or beige in dry material. Specimens of S. dendroicum have been identified as S. crotonoides, to which it is very similar, but differs in its upper leaf surfaces that dry much darker, and its white, stellate verging on lepidote rather than echinoid, leaf pubescence. Solanum dendroicum also lacks the prominent arching marginal vein of S. crotonoides, and has more (8-11 versus 5-7) pairs of primary leaf veins. Solanum crotonoides has long been known to be dioecious (see Whalen, 1984; Knapp et al., 1998), but this is the first suggestion that S. dendroicum is also unisexual. Plants that appear to be functionally female have inflorescences composed of a single pistillate flower, while those that are functionally male have branched inflorescences of fewer, slightly smaller flowers. This supposition needs to be confirmed with field studies in this species. "
wfo-0001030622,"Like Solanum inamoenum Benth. but differing in the congested inflorescence with the basal flower borne at the very base of the inflorescence and the inflorescence with a pseudo-peduncle, longer pedicels, and larger flowers and fruits. In his Flora of Fiji, Smith (1991) included many of the specimens here recognized as S. pseudopedunculatum in his concept of S. inamoenum Benth. The two species are not very similar morphologically, however, with leaf and stem pubescence differing in density (S. inamoenum pubescence is denser and the trichome rays are somewhat longer than in S. pseudopedunculatum), inflorescence structure (unbranched in S. pseudopedunculatum and highly branched in S. inamoenum), flower size (to 1 cm in diameter and homostylous in S. pseudopedunculatum, larger and heterostylous in S. inamoenum) and habitat preference (S. pseudopedunculatum is a plant of forests and secondary thickets, while S. inamoenum grows near the coast). Solanum pseudopedunculatum is much more similar to S. ratale but can be distinguished by its taller habit, mature leaves that retain pubescence along the veins and lamina, longer pedicels, and larger corolla, anthers, and berries."
wfo-0001032458,"Solanum viridifolium is the only member of Solanum section Dunaliana which predominantly occurs in Queensland, Australia and is uncommon on the Island of New Guinea. It also has a lax sometimes highly branched inflorescence instead of the typical condensed few branching inflorescence of Solanum section Dunaliana. Like all members of Solanum section Dunaliana, S. viridifolium has red fruits. Symon (1979) stated that the seeds of S. viridifolium are likely dispersed by birds. 
"
wfo-0001027829,"Solanum ensifolium is most similar and closely related to the widespread S. bahamense. It differs from S. bahamense in its black rather than red berries, shaggy appearance in the new growth and inflorescence due to the presence of stellate trichomes with elongate midpoints and in its higher elevation premontane habitat. In general, S. bahamense grows on calcareous soils near the coast throughout the Caribbean basin, while S. ensifolium is a plant of higher, more inland and slightly wetter elevations on Puerto Rico."
wfo-0001031022,"Once widespread and frequent (MacCaughey, 1917), on Oahu S. sandwicense is restricted to one reintroduced population. On Kauai, about fifteen wild individuals are known. Wagner et al. (1999) listed S. sandwicense as endangered. Conservation International and the National Tropical Botanical Garden include this species in their conservation efforts on Oahu and Kauai respectively. The specimens from Oahu and Kauai have at times been recognized as different species. Some specimens from Kauai have large lobes on leaves and ferruginous hairs with much longer stalks on the stems and leaves; however, these simply represent an extreme variant of the species. Still, all surviving forms of the species need to be protected. And, study on the population level may reveal genetic differences between the individuals of Oahu and Kauai. This species is named for the Sandwich Islands, an early name for the Hawaiian Islands.
"
wfo-0001029031,"The highly discolorous leaves of this species are similar to those of S. schlechtendalianum, but in S. lepidotum the whitish pubescence is formed by peltate or peltate-stellate hairs with a fused central portion, whereas in S. schlechtendalianum it is composed exclusively of stellate hairs. Some specimens of S. lepidotum have been misidentified as S. argenteum, a South American species. Solanum celsum, a morphologically closely related species, differs in its much less discolorous leaf surfaces with sparser hairs with the mesophyll visible between the hairs. The fused part of the rays is smaller than in S. lepidotum. In Costa Rica, S. celsum is found in the Cordillera de Talamanca and Osa Peninsula, whereas S. lepidotum is known from the Cordilleras de Guanacaste and Tilará.
"
wfo-0001031329,"Specimens of Ssolanum sotobosquense have been identified as S. arboreum Dunal, S. narcoticosmum Bitter, S. roblense Bitter, and S. vacciniiflorum Standi. & L.0.Williams by S. Knapp (pers. comm.) and others, but these specimens do not fit with the descriptions of any of those species. Solanum sotobosquense is densely puberulent on the new growth with minute glandular hairs and the leaf veins and mesophyll beneath are pubescent with unbranched, often gland-tipped hairs; the new growth and leaves of S. narcoticosmum are glabrous. It differs from S. arboreum in being a shrub or small tree (vs. a rhizomatous shrub). Its minutely glandular-puberulent fruits and large flowers distinguish it from S. roblense. Solanum sotobosquense lacks the distinctive hairs with reddish cross walls found in S. vacciniiflorum; the smaller, bullate leaves and deflexed fruiting pedicels of the latter species also help to distinguish the two species. The very long (20-35 mm), erect fruiting pedicels of S. sotobosquense differ from all the species mentioned above. Solarium arboreum, S. narcoticosmum, and S. roblense have erect fruiting pedicels up to about 20 mm long (to 25 mm in S. narcoticosmum; Knapp 2002). The fruiting pedicels of S. vacciniiflorum range from 18 to 30 mm long, approaching the length of those of S. sotobosquense, but they are deflexed rather than erect. Morphologically, Solarium sotobosquense is most similar to S. rovirosanum Donn. Sm. due to its large leaves, but the new species differs in its short, usually forked inflorescences (up to 1 cm long in S. sotobosquense vs. 1.5-8 cm long and often highly branched in S. rovirosanum) and long fruiting pedicels (20&mdash;35 mm long in S. sotobosquense vs. 8&mdash;13 mm long in S. rovirosanum). Solanum sotobosquense exhibits a number of characters found in Knapp's S. arboreum species group, such as difoliate and geminate sympodial units with strongly dimorphic leaves, short inflorescences with overlapping pedicel scars, and erect fruiting pedicels. At least three other species of this group, 5. arboreum, S. ramonense C. V. Morton & Standi., and S. roblense, have similar scurfy stems, major leaf veins, and inflorescence axes, where the surface cracks and peels into small plates. Molecular data (Bohs et al., unpublished) indicate that S. sotobosquense may be most closely related to 5. arboreum, S. ramonense, and S. roblense and is only distantly related to S. rovirosanum despite its superficial morphological similarity to the latter species.
"
wfo-0001025685,"Solanum accrescens can be recognised by its deeply lobed, stellate, white corolla, absence of stellate trichomes on the gynoecium which is covered with simple glandular trichomes, and unequal calyx lobes with 3 veins that visibly expand in fruit. This species can be confused with S. velutinum with which it shares 3-veined, unequal sepals and a fruit with simple glandular trichomes. Nevertheless, the sepals of S. velutinum are narrower, the corolla is purple and the pubescence of the adaxial leaf surfaces, pedicels and calyx is composed of sessile porrect stellate trichomes with reduced rays and long, multicellular midpoints. Specimens from Amazonian Ecuador identified as S. accrescens are S. velutinum. Specimens cited as Solanum accrescens from Venezuela by Benítez de Rojas & Medina (2001) do not match my concept of this taxon. Based on the description, plate and distribution in Benitez de Rojas & Medina (2001), the specimens are of S. mesopliarthrum, a Venezuelan species with great morphological plasticity that is superficially similar to and often confused with S. accrescens. Solanum mesopliarthrum is very common inthe regions cited in Benitez de Rojas & Medina (2001) as areas where S. accrescens was found in Venezuela."
wfo-0001025686,"The typical subspecies can be recognised by its shrubby habit, elliptic-lanceolate leaves with adpressed scabrous pubescence on the stems, upper leaf surfaces, peduncles and pedicels composed of sessile stellate trichomes with reduced midpoints that are ca. ¼ - 1/3 the length of the lateral rays. In juvenile plants the leaves are repand and the stems more prickly than in adult plants. A single collection from Costa Rica, Costich & Baldwin 1532, appears to have branched inflorescences."
wfo-0001025687,"The discontinuous variation exhibited by specimens from central Panama justifies the recognition of this subspecies, which principally occurs on Cerro Jefe and the area nearby. These specimens differ from Costa Rican material in having cordate to ovate leaves, acute (never acuminate) leaf apices, inflorescences with more flowers and smaller, more deltate sepals in fruit. The corolla is generally smaller (less than 3 cm in diameter) than that of Costa Rican specimens."
wfo-0001025652,"Solanum abitaguense is closely related to S. cucullatum of western Ecuador. Both species have strongly parallel primary leaf venation, fleshy leaves, and reddish papillose trichomes on the new growth. Solanum abitaguense and S. cucullatum are difficult to distinguish on the herbarium sheet, but fresh material is quite distinct. Characters useful in distinguishing S. abitaguense are its shorter buds, less fleshy, more deeply lobed corolla, and its strongly winged, green stems. Solanum abitaguense grows in light gaps along streams in forest, often with its roots in the water. The buds, flowers, fruits and seeds of S. abitaguense are the largest (barring S. cucullatum) in section Geminata. The calyx is peculiar in bud, being a closed structure, even at at the tip, until just before anthesis: the exsertion of the corolla tears the calyx into irregular lobes. This character, in young buds, is shared with S. cucullatum. Another peculiar character shared by these two extremely closely related species is the indument of the ovary, and then the fruit. The ovary in flower is densely covered with pinkish-grey papillose trichomes, which are much more obvious in dry than fresh specimens. The trichomes persist on the fruit but become less dense as the fruit expands. The trichomes on dry specimens appear somewhat resinous, but this is not at all apparent in fresh specimens."
wfo-0001027581,"Solanum dillonii is superficially similar to the widespread Solanum riparium Ruiz & Pav. and to the more southerly Solanum conglobatum Dunal. It differs from Solanum riparium in its violet flowers, acute leaf bases and pubescence; both stem and leaf trichomes of Solanum dillonii are very long-stalked and multangulate, while those of Solanum riparium are sessile and tend to have more rays (tending to echinoid sensu Roe 1971). Both species have some porrect-stellate trichomes on the lower leaf surfaces. Solanum riparium occurs in a wide variety of tropical and premontane forests of the eastern Andean slopes, and Solanum dillonii, while to some extent (in the Río Marañon valley) sympatric with it, is a plant of the moist to dry forests of the western Andean slopes and inter-Andean valleys in the Amotape-Huancabamba phytogeographic zone (Weigend 2002, 2004). Solanum dillonii is the species referred to as Solanum erianthum vel. aff.&quot; in the checklist of the Monte Seco forest fragment (Sagástegui and Dillon 1991). Solanum dillonii has also been misidentified as Solanum conglobatum, a species of dry forests from southern Peru and Bolivia. It is similar to Solanum conglobatum, with few-rayed trichomes on the upper leaf surfaces and dense abaxial leaf pubescence, but differs from that species in having multangulate rather than porrect-stellate trichomes abaxially and in not having an accrescent calyx in fruit. Solanum dillonii is another species endemic to the Amotape-Huancabamba phytogeographic zone (Weigend 2002, 2004); this region has been highlighted as a center of species richness and endemism in the Geminata clade (see Knapp 2002, Stern et al. 2009) of Solanum. The area is not only home to many endemics, such as Solanum dillonii, but is a zone of considerable overlap between northern and southern taxa.
"
wfo-0001028915,"Solanum lacteum is characterized by its tiny inflorescences with tightly packed flowers and the difoliate sympodia that are usually not conspicuously geminate. The leaves are narrowly obovate and widest in the distal third. They dry a characteristic blackish brown above and paler brown beneath. The inflorescences often occur internodally and are completely white, including the peduncle and pedicels. The colour of the leaves on herbarium specimens is similar to that of S. caavurana and S. campaniforme, but those species always have leaf pubescence on the lower leaf surfaces and more elongate inflorescences. The highly congested inflorescences of S. lacteum are distinctive and the species is not easily confused with any other growing sympatrically. It is somewhat similar to S. psilophyllum, which is similarly glabrous; differences between these two species are noted in the discussion of S. psilophyllum. Solanum lacteum grows in the understory of undisturbed forest and can vary from being a tiny subshrub (see Figure 2B in Knapp et al. 2015) to a small treelet ca. 5 m tall. This variation in height is common in members of the Geminata clade and may have to do with plant age and maturity.
"
wfo-0001032542,"Solanum xanthophaeum is closely related to S. malletii from Ecuador and northern Peru and differs from it in its smaller, brilliant yellow-green flowers, its glabrous fruits and in its golden yellow pubescence. Most of the collections of S. xanthophaeum have more compact pubescence than that of the type, but agree with the type in all other characters. Foster et al. 11320 and Schunke V. 6193 have the loose dendritic trichomes of the type. This difference may be due to habitat, with the plants with more compact trichomes growing in more exposed or drier sites."
wfo-0001030522,"Solanum polygamum is one of the few documented dioecious species of Solanum, and with S. crotonoides, the only confirmed dioecious Caribbean species in the genus (although other taxa are thought to be dioecious based on flower morphology, e.g. S. dendroicum, S. punctulatum etc.). Flower morphology in S. polygamum is the most extreme of any dioecious solanum (see Knapp et al., 1998), with the female flowers having withered anthers containing no pollen grains. Vahl (1794) suggested S. polygamum might be dioecious based on West’s field observations: “Flores alii masculi alii hermaphorditi Dn. West, ego tantem masculos vidi, an potius dioica?” Plate 55 in Symbolae botanicae (Vahl, 1794) is of a male plant. The large, pubescent fruit of S. polygamum is similar to those of the members of section Lasiocarpa (e.g. S. quitoense, S. lasiocarpum, S. candidum). Vegetatively, however, S. polygamum is very different from those taxa, all of which have large, repand leaves. DNA sequences from S. polygamum were very difficult to align with other solanums (L. Bohs, pers. comm.) and to date, this species is of uncertain relationships."
wfo-0001032509,"This species is similar to the more widespread S. albidum, but is more robust in nearly every part and is usually found at higher altitudes. It is more restricted ecologically; in the area where they are sympatric in Bolivia, S. albidum grows from 270 to 2600 meters, but is generally found below 2000 m, whereas S. whalenii is restricted to 1800-3000 meters. The color of the fully mature fruits is not known; they are held erect on erect inflorescences and if they remain dark green, it may indicate that they are dispersed by bats. Solanum whalenii is one of the most spectacular species of section Torva (Solanum torvum group sensu Whalen, 1984). A photograph of the flower appears on the cover of a theme issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Biological Sciences dedicated to “Taxonomy for the twenty-first century” (Godfray & Knapp, 2004). Etymology: The epithet honors Michael Dennis Whalen, an expert on the Solanaceae, whose work on Solanum was cut short much too soon."
wfo-0001027273,"Solanum costatum is characterised by the strongly bicolorous leaves, dark and nearly glabrous above and densely light-tomentose below. The calyx is 5-ribbed soon after corolla dehiscence, and these ribs are still visible in the accrescent fruiting calyx. Solanum costatum can be most easily confused with two other species of Solanum with bicolorous leaves also found in the Guianas, S. rubiginosum and S. paludosum. Solanum rubiginosum has inflorescences often longer than the associated leaves, inflorescences always pedunculate (peduncle 1.5-4cm long) and multibranching, fruits stellate-tomentose, always with prickles. Solanum costatum has upper leaf surfaces glabrous except along the major veins, inflorescences often appearing 2-ranked, and fruits nearly glabrous. Solanum paludosum has hairy upper leaf surfaces beyond the major veins, inflorescences appearing 1-ranked, and fruits stellate-tomentose."
wfo-0001028680,"This species has an extremely localized distribution. By sheer coincidence the locality is also one of the most beautiful in all of New Caledonia. Solanum insulae-pinorum is found only on ile des Pins in the vicinity of 'la piscine naturalle', a large tidal pool and popular vacation spot for New Caledonians and visiting tourists. Few species have postcards made of the type locality, but this is one. This species is part of a morphologically similar group of native New Caledonian solanums with relatively small leaves and short shoots which typically bear the inflorescences (e.g., S. hugonis, S. vaccinoides).
"
wfo-0001344894,"Solanum lagoense is similar to Solanum restingae S. Knapp, S. amorimii S. Knapp & Giacomin, and S. psilophyllum Stehmann & Giacomin but differs from them by its pilose stems and longer fruiting pedicels (> 1.5 cm long). Solanum lagoense is a small shrub with entirely glabrous leaves, short inflorescences, few small flowers, and green fruits that are hidden below the foliage. These characters are common in species belonging to Geminata clade, a group that is highly diverse in the Atlantic forest (Knapp 2002; Knapp et al. 2015). Solanum lagoense is similar to S. restingae, S. amorimii and S. psilophyllum Stehmann & Giacomin due to its glabrous and geminate, but not dimorphic leaves. The latter three species are distinguished by their glabrous stems, even on the new growth, and short fruiting pedicels (up to 1.5 cm long), whereas S. lagoense has clearly pilose young stems and longer fruiting pedicels. Solanum restingae is endemic to Bahia and Espírito Santo states and has a strongly winged stem and basally attenuate leaves. Solanum amorimii grows in southern Bahia, but also in far northeastern Minas Gerais; its stem is not winged, the leaves are somewhat auriculate at the base. Despite its occurrence in the region of the Serra do Cipó and the Iron Quadrangle relatively close to Lagoa Santa, S. psilophyllum has longer petioles (>1.5 cm) and leaves (>10 cm) and more flowers per inflorescence (5–8)."
wfo-0001028692,"Solanum involucratum is a distinctive species, with pubescent berries entirely enclosed within a spiny accrescent calyx. In flower the corolla lobes are shorter than the calyx, so the flowers appear to be entirely within the calyx at anthesis. In flower the calyx tube appears to be somewhat inflated, but it is appressed against the berry in fruit. The bristly, prickly accrescent calyx in fruit is similar to that of S. barbisetum, S. cyanocarphium and S. praetermissum, but all of those species have glabrous fruits, while those of S. involucratum are densely pubescent with stiff, stellate trichomes. The inflorescences of S. cyanocarphium are few-flowered like those of S. involucratum, but not robust. Inflorescences of S. barbisetum and S. praetermissum are elongate and multi-flowered."
wfo-0001031127,"Solanum schulzianum is extremely variable in both prickliness and in leaf shape. Leaves vary from almost simple with a very shallowly toothed margin (e.g. Ekman H.12268) to almost pinnatifid (e.g., Ekman H.5012). The stems vary from nearly prickle-free to densely prickly, and this may be in part related to plant age, with more juvenile plants being more prickly. Flowers are said to be dark purple to reddish, an unusual color in Solanum. Judging for the number of collections, S. schulzianum is not rare where it occurs, although it is of extremely restricted distribution. Solanum schulzianum is very similar to S. selleanum, also from Hispaniola. The two species share deeply lobed to pinnatifid leaves, densely prickly stems and leaf surfaces and elongate, whip-like inflorescences with flowers in the distal half. Without looking closely at the pubescence and calyx morphology the species are almost identical on the herbarium sheet, but S. schulzianum has sparser leaf pubescence of porrect stellate trichomes with few rays and purple flowers, while S. selleanum has densely pubescent leaf undersides with a combination of porrect stellate trichomes with 8-10 rays and a dense fine covering of sessile stellate trichomes and white flowers. Solanum selleanum has broadly deltate calyx lobes rather than the distinctive long-triangular lobes with prominent sinuses of S. schulzianum. The calyx of S. selleanum appears to be dark purple, while that of S. schulzianum is green or whitish green. The taxa grow at similar elevations and in similar pine wood habitat and are probably closely related. The long, whip-like inflorescence of S. schulzianum is shared with several other Caribbean endemic Solanum species, e.g., S. selleanum, S. chamaeacanthum, S. miragoae and S. gundlachii. "
wfo-0001029073,"Solanum lidii is a striking species, with its deep purple, highly zygomorphic flowers and orange fruits when ripe. It is easily distinguished from S. vespertilio, the only other prickly solanum with zygomorphic flowers in the Canary Islands, by its narrow, rather than broadly ovate, leaves, its darker purple flowers (see Figure 1 in Anderson et al., 2006), and its orange, rather than red berry. The two species also differ in habitat, with S. vespertilio occurring in relictual laurel forests and S. lidii occurring on dry, rocky slopes. Solanum lidii occasionally has 4-merous flowers, while it seems that almost all populations of S. vespertilio are 4-merous. Whalen (1984) suggested that S. lidii and S. vespertilio were closely related to the morphologically very similar zygomorphic flowered solanum of the New World, S. houstonii (as S. tridynamum). Recent molecular studies have shown that these two Canary Island species are more closely related to solanums of the African mainland (Anderson et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2006), although sampling from amongst this diverse group was not broad enough to pin down their true relationships. Solanum lidii is known from less than ten scattered populations on southern Gran Canaria (Bramwell, 2006) the largest of which has less than 50 individuals. "
wfo-0001029569,"Solanum milnei is most similar to S. austro-caledonicum and S. vanuatuense. It differs from the former by having lanceolate to ovate leaves 2.6-3 times as long as wide with sparse pubescence across the blade, margin of the leaves typically minutely undulate-crenate, leaf apices typically long acuminate, and 7-10 veins on either side of the midvein. The inflorescences are also more branched, the calyx lobes reflexed in fruit, and it has smaller fruits. It differs from S. vanuatuense by having unlobed leaves borne individually, larger corollas and anthers, straight styles.
"
wfo-0001030580,"Solanum pseuderanthemoides is quite distinctive. Though it has small leaves like several other species of Solanum from New Caledonia, it does not have shorts shoots or prickles. The species has been reported as holding its branches horizontal, giving herbarium specimens a natural two-dimensional look unlike the flattened look of most herbarium specimens. The species also has a pronounced difference between the ferruginous pubescence of the stem and the yellow pubescence of the petioles, which is unique within Solanum section Irenosolanum. In 2009, the type locality, along Hermitage Stream, was visited but no living material was discovered. Jaffré et al. (1998) listed this species as critically endangered; it has been collected once in the last ca. 100 years."
wfo-0001030195,"Solanum pancheri is part of a group of native New Caledonian Solanums with relatively small leaves and short shoots which typically bear the inflorescences. However, it does not closely resemble any other species of section Irenosolanum; its spatulate leaves appearing clustered on the short shoots give it a very unusual aspect. Furthermore, it is the only member of section Irenosolanum for which only 4-merous flowers are known. Though prickles are infrequently on specimens of S. pancheri, the species can have them. This is an important character since prickles are absent in many species of section Irenosolanum. Jaffré et al. (1998) listed S. pancheri as near threatened. This species was named to honor Jean Armand Isidore Pancher (1814-1877) a French gardener and botanist who collected in New Caledonia.
"
wfo-0001032286,"Like Solanum milnei Seem. and S. austrocaledonicum Seem., but differing in usually geminate, lobed leaves, smaller corolla and anthers, and strongly curved style. Specimens of Solanum vanuatuense were included in the sympatric S. milnei Seem. (Seemann 1866) in the original description of the latter; it differs from that species in its smaller flowers and geminate leaves that are often lobed. Solanum vanuatuense is also similar to S. austrocaledonicum Bitter of New Caledonia and Vanuatu from which it can be distinguished by its geminate leaves that are often deeply lobed, its deltate calyx lobes (rather than long apiculate on a truncate rim) and small flowers. Solanum vanuatuense and S. austrocaledonicum co-occur on the island of Anatom (Schmid 5149 is S. vanuatuense and Schmid 5149b is S. austrocaledonicum – both specimens mounted on P00315283)."
wfo-0001028478,"Solanum hugonis is most similar to S. vaccinioides but is easily distinguished by the leaf shape and texture and by its spatulate calyx lobes which are unique within section Irenosolanum. Few collections of this species have been made as it is only known from the type locality. Jaffré et al. (1998) listed S. hugonis as critically endangered because of its highly restricted distribution. The species is part of a group of native New Caledonian Solanums with relatively small leaves and short shoots which typically bear the inflorescences.
This species was name to honor Hugh S. MacKee (1912-1995), a prolific plant collector in New Caledonia.
"
wfo-0001032453,"Within section Irenosolanum, Solanum viride is of particular interest because it was domesticated. Both the leaves and fruits were eaten and desirable traits were selected for in both. As would be expected, leaves and fruit were selected for increased size, and leaves were also selected for glabrousness. Since two organs were the object of selection, the various domesticates of S. viride display a wide range of morphology. Some domesticates have large glabrous leaves but relatively small fruits while others have both glabrous leaves and large fruits. Some large fruited types have a thickened mesocarp which adds fleshiness to the fruits while others do not. Besides uses as food, the leaves of S. viride are used medicinally in Tonga (Whistler, 1991), and the decorative fruits are made into crowns in the Society Islands (Papy, 1955) and garlands on Niue (Yuncker 10039). The variability of the different domesticates could be recognized at the varietal level, but more investigation, especially in the field, is needed. The exact area of domestication of S. viride remains unknown. The matter is complex because many domesticated forms can become established in the wild as was noted by Whistler (1991) and as can be seen from herbarium material. Though Fiji cannot be ruled out, perhaps the best candidate for the domestication is Samoa (including American Samoa). The widest range of domesticated forms comes from Samoa, and specimens with many small fruits and pubescent leaves are found there. These specimens could represent the wild progenitor because of these undesirable/less palatable traits, but again more investigation is needed. "
wfo-0001026422,"Solanum austro-caledonicum is the most widespread and common species of section Irenosolanum in New Caledonia. Heine (1976) placed this species under synonymy with S. tetrandrum from Northern Australia. Symon (1985) agreed with Heine's (1976) treatment though he believed some subspeciation had likely occurred as some characters illustrated by Heine disagreed with the Australian S. tetrandrum s.s. Symon (1985) dubbed what he believed to be a species complex involving S. tetrandrum s.s., S. austro-caledonicum as a few other species the S. tetrandrum complex. While there is a complex of similar species in the western Pacific corresponding to Symon's (1985) none are closely related to S. tetrandrum (see chapter 1). The complex is composed of S. austro-caledonicum, S. inamoenum, S. vanuatuense, and S. milnei. The morphological similarity of these species has confounded many workers. Careful, synchronous examination of a large quantity of herbarium specimens revealed the different taxa. Like most Solanums, Solanum austro-caledonicum is morphologically plastic. It can be a short shrub or small tree depending on the local environment. The leaf size can vary greatly, and the inflorescence can be unbranched or branched several times. Before, the species was so well represented in the herbarium, some of these forms were named. Field observations were especially useful for understanding the morphological variation of herbarium specimens. Still, there are several unusual specimens which I place under S. austro-caledonicum with some hesitation. Some of these may represent distinct taxa, but more and higher quality collections are needed."
wfo-0001025847,"Solanum aloysiifolium is widely distributed and a common plant of disturbed areas in northern Argentina. It often forms large stands and can range from tiny shrubs to almost tree-like forms. Like many species of morelloids (e.g., S. nigrum, see Särkinen et al. 2018) fruit colour is polymorphic with plants having either green or purple berries at maturity. The long-pedunculate forked inflorescences with narrowly elliptic buds that develop into deeply stellate corollas with a greenish yellow central star of shiny tissue make this species distinctive. The species is morphologically closely related to S. cochabambense, but S. cochabambense differs from S. aloysiifolium in its more highly branched inflorescences (those of S. aloysiifolium are usually only forked), buds that are ellipsoid with long-triangular calyx lobes rather than narrowly ellipsoid with short-triangular calyx lobes and larger less deeply stellate corollas. The anthers of S. aloysiifolium are narrow relative to their length (3.9–5 mm long and 0.6–1 mm wide in S. aloysiifolium versus 3.5–4 mm long and 0.9–1.2 mm wide in S. cochabambense) but this character can be difficult to see in the absence of comparative material. The berries of S. cochabambense are larger (1–1.2 cm in diameter) than those of S. aloysiifolium (0.5–0.6 cm in diameter), with similar numbers of stone cells. Solanum aloysiifolium could also be confused with the widespread and weedy S. chenopodioides; both taxa have matte berries and deeply stellate corollas. They differ in inflorescence morphology (forked in S. aloysiifolium, unbranched in S. chenopodioides) and stone cell number (ca. 10 or more in S. aloysiifolium, absent in S. chenopodioides). The distinctive down-turned fruiting peduncle of S. chenopodioides is never found in S. aloysiifolium."
wfo-0001029053,"Solanum leratii is most similar to S. semisucculentum but can be distinguished by its pubescent stems, petioles, and midveins of the leaves with the midpoints of the stellae much longer than the rays, persistent pubescence on the inflorescences, robust pedicels, the adaxial surface of the corolla nearly glabrous, and ovate fruits held erect and sometimes a nipple at the apex. Solanum leratii was treated as a synonym of S. tetrandrum (= S. austro-caledonicum) by Heine (1976) therefore is was not treated by Jaffré et al. (1998); in light of its resurrection and recognition as an accepted species, the conservation status of S. leratii needs to be reevaluated. Name for Auguste-Joseph Le Rat (1872-1910) a botanist in New Caledonia and collector of the type specimen.

wfo-0001028583,"Once thought to be extinct this species persists on the United States Army P?hakuloa Training Area. Several conservation measures have been taken since the discovery of living material, including ex situ conservation and fencing of in situ individuals. Threats to this species include seed predation by rats, herbivory by feral goats, and destruction from military training (<a href=""https://www.dodlegacy.org/Legacy/project/productdocs/IC%20Legacy%20Project%20Final%20Report%20v9_1_90fda059-7696-4242-a454-fba2ff8e3650.pdf"">VanderWerf et al., 2008</a>). This is the only species of section Irenosolanum with prickles sometimes present on the calyx. Wagner et al. (1999) listed S. incompletum as endangered. My recognition of S. hillebrandii which Wagner et al. (1999) included under S. incompletum will not alter the conservation status of S. incompletum as no living individuals S. hillebrandii would be removed from the population of S. incompletum. Dunal (1952) named this species from the sterile, and thus incomplete, material collected by David Nelson on Captain Cook's third voyage.
"
wfo-0001031701,"Solanum terminale is the most widespread and common species of the ANS clade on the African mainland, and is often recognised as three distinct entities; S. nakurense, S. terminale s.s. and S. welwitschii (e.g., Edmonds 2012). Bitter (1917, 1922) recognised 20 species and 23 infraspecific taxa, while Heine (1960) amalgamated all these into a single species with three infraspecific taxa in western Africa, and suggested that a similar course of action needed to be taken throughout the continent. We are recognising these populations as a single species because the characters used to distinguish them are continuously variable and field observations indicate that habitat plays a significant role in overall morphology. Solanum terminale is not broadly sympatric with any other species of the ANS clade, although in eastern South Africa S. africanum also occurs, but not strictly sympatrically; S. runsoriense also occurs in the same regions as S. terminale but usually at higher elevations. Solanum terminale is easily distinguished from others in the clade by its flowers with densely papillate abaxial corolla lobes, flowers clustered at the ends of inflorescence branches (of varying length) and bright red berries. Populations from western Africa tend to have shorter inflorescence branches, tightly connate anthers and elongate berries and have been recognised as S. welwitschii, while those from eastern Africa have more open inflorescences, more loosely connate anthers and globose berries and have been called S. terminale. Small plants with few-flowered inflorescences primarily from eastern Africa have been called S. nakurense. The leaves of S. terminale are usually pubescent to some degree, but are occasionally completely glabrous (e.g., the type of S. welwitschii). Dense tufts of trichomes in the vein axils (domatia) do not occur in S. terminale, but the pubescence is often denser near the midvein. In order to determine if there was any geographical component to the morphogical variation seen in S. terminale, we measured the key characters used to distinguish S. terminale from S. welwitschii in a range of specimens from across continental Africa. Long thin buds that open to flowers with fused anthers, and spicate inflorescences with short to non-existent branches are thought to be typical of S. welwitschii (e.g., Edmonds 2012). Neither character segregated clearly into two classes in our simple analysis. Bud shape is similarly distributed across longitude, but the longest, thinnest buds occur in western Africa. Spicate inflorescences are somewhat more common in the wet forests of western Africa. The type of Solanum welwitschii var. laxepaniculatum (Mildbraed 5265), however, is a good example of a terminale type inflorescence in western Africa. Anthers on specimens from wet forests of western Africa were more often fused than those from drier forests of eastern Africa. Anther connation may be a way of protecting pollen in damp, humid environments, but this remains to be tested. The characters used to distinguish the taxa we here recognise as the single species S. terminale appear to be the extremes of continuous variation, and perhaps represent fixation of particular morphologies in certain populations. Field study of these plants coupled with molecular analysis at the population level will be essential to untangle the complex morphological variation with S. terminale."
wfo-0001029619,"Solanum monachophyllum is found at low elevations throughout northern South America from Bolivar Department, Colombia in the west to French Guiana in the east and Para, Brazil in the south. Nearly all collection labels indicate that the species occurs along or near rivers or streams. Field observations of S. monachophyllum on the Essequibo River in Guyana found the species growing on sandbars with what appeared to be a persistent woody base and annual growth of small, herbaceous shoots. These sandbars were above water in the dry season but the high water marks on the riverbanks indicated that they could be as much as 3 m underwater in the wet season. Although there is variability between collections, S. monachophyllum is consistently the least prickly species of the section, perhaps due to the fact that it rarely climbs on other vegetation and thus does not require the roselike spines for climbing. The leaves of S. monachophyllum are widest below the midpoint and are typically unlobed but rapidly growing shoot might have 2-3 coarse lobes per side. The stamens of S. monachophyllum often appear to be disorganized, that is some stamens in a given flower might be slightly longer or spreading while others are more tightly connivent. The epithet is from the Greek monachos- meaning single or solitary and -phyll meaning leaf.
"
wfo-0001022550,"Where they co-occur, Lycianthes synanthera may be confused with L.heteroclita (Sendtn.) Bitter and L. nitida Bitter, because all three species have calyces lacking appendages and may be epiphytic. Lycianthes heteroclita has very herbaceous young growth that collapses at the nodes upon drying in a plant press, while L. synanthera and L. nitida have woody upper stems that do not collapse at the nodes upon drying. In addition, L. synanthera usually has hairs in the axils of the primary veins on the abaxial leaf surface, and it has very large anther pores that open along the edges of the anther sac where it joins to the adjacent anther, nearly becoming confluent with the pore of the adjacent anther; these characters are lacking in both L. heteroclita and L. nitida. In addition, L. nitida has shiny, coriaceous leaves with geminate pairs in which the smaller of the pair is much smaller in size and more rounded than the larger leaf. The leaf texture in L. synanthera is thick-chartaceous, and the leaves are not shiny; rather the blades are a dull green-brown upon drying, which contrasts with the petioles that dry a very dark brown."
wfo-0001022271,"Lycianthes caeciliae is a species that was poorly collected until the 21st century. Other than the type collection, it was just collected one other time in the 20th century by Matuda. Due to many excellent collections made at La Cortadura on the slopes of Cofre de Perote by Gonzalo Castillo-Campos between 2005 and 2007, this species was rediscovered. The species is most abundant in original oak cloud forest where it is in flower and fruit; although present in secondary forest of Alnus or Liquidambar at lower elevations in the area of La Cortadura, the plants are small and often sterile. Lycianthes caeciliae is closely related to Lycianthes pilifera, a Oaxacan cloud forest endemic, with which is shares simple, straight, spreading trichomes that do not collapse upon drying, corollas with purple and green coloration, purple anthers, purple coloration in the calyx, and dark purple fruit with large brown seeds. Lycianthes caeciliae could be confused with Lycianthes stephanocalyx, a rhizomatous herb to subshrub which also occurs in Veracruz, but at lower elevations. Lycianthes stephanocalyx differs from L. caeciliae in having small incurved trichomes, yellow connivant anthers, red fruits, and tan seeds (Dean et al. 2019).
"
wfo-0001032335,"The original description of Solanum verecundum (Nee 2000) included one specimen segregated by KNapp(2010) as Solanum oxapampense. The taxa differ in a suite of characters, detailed in the discussion of Solanum oxapampense, but are easy to distinguish by leaf morphology; the leaves of Solanum oxapampense are coriaceous and shiny above while those of Solanum verecundum are membranous or chartaceous and pubescent above. These stellate trichomes cause the leaves to be asperous to the touch on dry specimens. The stellate trichomes of Solanum verecundum, while somewhat peltate like those of Solanum oxapampense, never have the rays fused for more than half their length, and always bear midpoints, even if these are quite tiny. Nee (2000) pointed out the morphological similarity between Solanum verecundum and the similarly widespread Solanum lepidotum Dunal and Solanum schlechtendalianum Walp. The latter two taxa have more lateral inflorescences that are not borne on erect peduncles. Solanum lepidotum and Solanum schlechtendalianum show a similar pattern of hair diversity to Solanum verecundum and Solanum oxapampense; each species pair has one member with porrect-stellate trichomes with the rays not fused (Solanum schlechtendalianum and Solanum verecundum) and one with peltate trichomes (Solanum lepidotum and Solanum oxapampense). Taxonomists working with primarily morphological data have traditionally recognised different sub-groupings for taxa with stellate and peltate trichomes (Seithe 1962, Carvalho 1996, Nee 1999), but molecular data (Bohs 2005, Weese and Bohs 2007) suggest a more complex situation.
"
wfo-0001025895,"Solanum amorimii is morphologically very similar to the sympatric S. restingae, but can be distinguished by its much smaller flowers with long-triangular calyx lobes and by its unwinged stem. Both species grow in the understory of mostly undisturbed forests and can be small shrubs or treelets. Solanum restingae has markedly cucullate corolla lobes, and the calyx lobes are so small as to be almost non-existent, especially in fruit. Bud shape also differs between the two species, with those of S. amorimii being globose to somewhat ellipsoid and those of S. restingae more elongate with a distinct nipple from the cucullate corolla tips. In fruit the two species can be difficult to distinguish, but the winged stems of S. restingae and the presence of calyx lobes in S. amorimii should enable identification. Leaves of S. amorimii are usually somewhat auriculate at the base, with the base not surrounding the stem but enlarged to a very short petiole. Plants grow in forest understory, sometimes in open places such as treefall gaps. From overall morphology this species would belong to the S. arboreum species group of Knapp (2002), but its relationships have not been tested using molecular sequences.
"
wfo-0001022433,"Lycianthes manantlanensis is sometimes confused with L. orogenes Standl. & Steyerm. and L. barbatula Standl. & Steyerm., and it is probable that the three are closely related, because they share similarities in floral structure, such as a white, stellate corolla and yellow anthers that sometimes have a brownish connective. Lycianthes barbatula differs from the other two species in having tufts of trichomes in the vein axils on the abaxial leaf side. Lycianthes manantlanensis differs from L. orogenes in having a calyx that nearly lacks calyx appendages and often tears in fruit, as well as having equal to slightly unequal stamens (Dean et al. 2020). The original description of L. manantlanensis incorrectly stated that the species is endemic to Mexico, the mature fruits are green, and the stamens are equal (Rodríguez and Vargas 2002). This species ranges to El Salvador, the mature fruits are purple, the immature fruits are green, and the stamens are often slightly unequal, with one stamen slightly longer than the other four (Dean et al. 2020). Specimens of this species collected in El Salvador and Guatemala had been identified originally as Lycianthes orogenes, and many of the specimens were collections made by Standley or Steyermark, the original authors of that species. Examination of the type material of L. manantlanensis and L. orogenes shows differences in the calyx structure that allowed some of the Guatemalan and all of the El Salvadorian material to L. manantlanensis (Dean et al. 2020).
"
wfo-0001022489,"Lycianthes purpusii is a wide-ranging species of high tropical forest and relatively low elevations. It is distinguished by very long calyx appendages (7-17 mm long in flower) and dendritically branched or long-stalked multangulate-stellate trichomes. The species is variable in leaf arrangement; the leaves are usually paired (geminate) in Honduras but unpaired in many places in Mexico. It is also variable in the length of the pedicels (sometimes becoming unusually long in Guatemala) and the color and density of the pubescence. This species is somewhat similar to L. furcatistellata Bitter of Costa Rica but differs from that species in habitat preference (L. furcatistellata occurs in upper elevations, often in cloud forest), length of the pedicels (L. purpusii often has flowering pedicels less than 20 mm long, while L. furcatistellata usually has pedicels greater than 20 mm long), and calyx appendage length (L. furcatistellata has appendages on the flowering calyxes of 4 mm or less). The two species do not have overlapping distributions. Several specimens with dense, soft, very branched calyx trichomes, very short pedicels, and flowers in very tight groupings are included in this species circumscription, and they might prove to be a separate species.
"
wfo-0001022279,"Lycianthes chiapensis var. sparsistellata is an upper elevation cloud forest species that ranges from Veracruz to Honduras (possibly Nicaragua) mostly along the Atlantic slope. It can grow into a very tall liana that can cover the tree canopy, supported by a very large twining woody stem. The lower sympodial units merge into sinuate woody branches as the plant ages. The mature wood is dark brown and lustrous. This variety is the more common of the two varieties of Lycianthes chiapensis and differs from var. chiapensis in having a smaller flowering calyx that becomes plate-like as the plant fruits. The other variety has a larger flowering calyx that adheres to the fruit as it ages and a larger fruit with more seeds. Although most authors of floras (for example: Nee, 1986; Gentry & Standley, 1974) have synonymized the two varieties, they appear to be very different with regard to calyx morphology and fruit size, and so we are keeping them separate in this treatment. Standley and Steyermark introduced confusion into the description of the two varieties when describing var. sparsistellata for the first time (Standl. & Steyerm., 1940). The type of var. sparsistellata is clearly that of the small calyx form, but then one of the paratypes cited (Purpus 7166) from Cerrro del Boqueron, Chiapas) is clearly the large calyx form. In describing var. sparsistellata, the authors chose to emphasize pubescence density and ignored the differences in calyx and fruit size. The specimens from Nicaragua have smaller flowers and pedicel lengths than the populations further north.

wfo-1000023514,"Lycianthes fortunensis is morphologically cimilar and perhaps closely related to L. multiflora Bitter, which is known from Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, and the two other members of the L. multiflora complex in Panama, L. howardiana D'Arcy and L. porteriana D'Arcy. All four species have similar pubescence of sessile to short-stalked multangulate-stellate trichomes with rays that are often crisped and that lie flat on the plant surface, especially on the leaves. All four species also share having unequal stamens, a similar leaf shape (ovate to elliptic), and similar leaf texture (chartaceous to subcoriaceous). Lycianthes fortunensis differs from the other three in having round to oval flower buds with round tips (rather than conical buds with acute tips) and in lacking appendages (rather than having appendages that are usually 1-4 mm long [in L. multiflora] or even longer [to 11 mm in L. porteriana]). Lycianthes fortunensis also differs from L. multiflora and L. howardiana in having a prominent, scarious, often lobed calyx margin 0.5-2 mm long, a feature it shares with L. porteriana.

wfo-0001022334,"Lycianthes gorgonea is a distinctive species of lower elevation tropical rain forest, often found on limestone. The divaricate, zigzag branching of this species, in combination with a distinctive size/shape difference of the paired geminate leaves, soft long, pale trichomes, and very long calyx appendages, is quite different from any other species of Lycianthes in Mexico and Central America. The pollination of this species was studied in Belize by Smith and Knapp (2002), and they found that the flowers are visited by the bee genus Paratetrapedia.
"
wfo-0001029751,"Solanum neei is undoubtedly placed within sect. Acanthophora due to the lack of stellate hairs and the presence of simple hairs on the upper leaf surfaces. Because of its flattened and winged seeds, Solanum neei would be placed in the Pterosperma group of sect. Acanthophora in the taxonomic scheme of Nee (1979a; see Levin et al. 2005 for an explanation of Nee's subsectional groups). However, Levin et al. (2005) demonstrated that the groupings based on seed morphology are unnatural, although they did not sample all species of the section. Therefore, the phylogenetic position of Solanum neei within sect. Acanthophora is unknown. Morphologically, Solanum neei resembles Solanum incarceratum, but the well developed peduncles of the inflorescences (Figs 1, 2) distinguish it from the latter, which has sessile or almost sessile inflorescences. Other characteristics that also help to distinguish these two species are the leaf shape (barely lobed in Solanum incarceratum), the fruit shape (globose in Solanum incarceratum) and the distribution range: Solanum incarceratum inhabits Peru, Bolivia and the states of Bahia, Goiás and Minas Gerais (Brazil), therefore it would overlap with Solanum nee only in a small area in the Brazilian state of Paraná. Solanum anoacanthum has also some resemblance to Solanum neei: both species have long calyx lobes that are equal to or longer than the corolla lobes and longer than half of the fruit, but in Solanum anoacanthum the lobes are wider and petaloid, whilst in the latter, they are linear-lanceolate to linear and not more than 1 mm wide.
Some species of sect. Acanthophora have derived breeding systems and are andromonoecious (with both long- and short-styled flowers in the same inflorescence, e.g., Solanum capsicoides), but the new species seems not to be andromonoecious, since all specimens studied had inflorescences with only long-styled flowers."
wfo-0001026335,"This species is very similar to and sympatric with S. celsum, but differs in its pubescence of stellate hairs with very elongated and usually gland-tipped midpoints and without a fused central portion. Solanum armentalis can be distinguished from S. cordovense by its long peduncles and small flowers with short calyx lobes. Unlike S. lepidotum and S. schlechtendalianum, the leaf surfaces of S. armentalis are not strongly discolorous (green adaxially and white abaxially).
"
wfo-0001022547,"Lycianthes surotatensis is very similar to Lycianthes tricolor (Dun.) Bitter in its pedicel length and corolla size. It differs from that species in having unnotched seeds and having glandular pubescence at least on the pedicels or calyx. In addition, the calyx length and calyx appendage length are usually longer in L. surotatensis. In the protologue for L. surotatensis, Gentry (1948) did not note the presence of glandular trichomes on the type specimen and concentrated instead on the dentate margins that are present on some of the leaves of the type specimen. However, the trichomes on the leaves, pedicels, and calyx of the type specimen are clearly glandular, and the character of the dentate leaf margins is not consistently present within the species and sometimes can occur in other species of series Tricolores (Dean et al. 2017, 2020).

wfo-0001028467,"Solanum houstonii has the most pronounced flower dimorphism in group, with differences in size and shape of both corolla and anthers. Staminate flowers are larger and exhibit stronger anther zygomorphy, while hermaphrodites tend to be smaller and with anthers of more equal size. The anther dimorphism in hermaphroditic flowers of S. houstonii is similar to that seen in both flower morphs of S. hindsianum and S. homalospermum. On the coast of western Mexico S. houstonii grows in sympatry with S. hindsianum; it differs from that species in its larger fruit, more dimorphic flowers, more prickly calyx of long-styled flowers, and usually lobed leaves. Populations from around the bay of Topolobambo in Sinaloa are unusual in having deeply pinnatifid leaves, and individuals from northwestern Mexico are polymorphic for purple or yellow anther coloration."
wfo-0001022369,"Lycianthes jalicensis occurs at the low elevations and in habitats that can also be inhabited by the Mexican and Central American L. arrazolensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter; some populations of L. arrazolensis also share the white, campanulate corollas and seeds found in L. jalicensis. The two species differ in that L. jalicensis has longer pedicels (the length more similar to that of the Mexican and Central American L. tricolor (Dun.) Bitter), has glabrous calyces and corollas, and usually has larger floral dimensions than L. arrazolensis. Lycianthes jalicensis differs from L. tricolor by having unnotched seeds, more glabrous calyces and flowers, and a lower elevational range (Dean et al. 2020).

wfo-0001031231,"Solanum simile is one of the more widespread species of the Archaesolanum clade in Australia, but it seems to grow in small, transient populations associated with disturbance (Symon, 1981). Plants of S. simile are similar to those of S. laciniatum, but are generally more slender. It share with S. vescum, S. capsiciforme and S. symonii green fruit and maturity, but the berries of S. simile are often speckled or flushed with black, giving an overall brown cast. Symon (1981) has suggested that this coloration is related to temperature. Crosses between Solanum simile have been made with the diploid species S. aviculare, S. linearifolium and S. vescum and with the tetraploid species S. laciniatum and S. symonii (summarized in Symon, 1994). Counts of seeds and stony cell concentrations in Solanum simile are highly variable, one collection of 8 fruits had (32-) 67 (-86) seeds and (18-) 25 (-35) concretions (the lowest mean number), while another collection of 8 fruits had (105-) 125 (-154) seeds and (22-) 30 (-35) concretions (the highest mean number of seeds) (Symon, 1994)"
wfo-0001032206,"Solanum umtuma is a medium-sized subshrub with straight prickles, acute to obtuse leaf lobes, and large yellow fruits. It is almost certainly a close relative of the sympatric Solanum linnaeanum; the two species share long, leafy, prickly calyx lobes on long-styled flowers and fruits and differ primarily in the shape of their leaf lobes. Solanum linnaeanum is immediately recognisable by its quite deeply incised leaves with rounded lobes; a few intermediate specimens of Solanum umtuma have somewhat rounded lobes, e.g. R.G. Strey 6750 (K000441991). Label data indicate that Solanum umtuma has white or only occasionally violet to mauve flowers, while Solanum linnaeanum always has purple flowers. Solanum umtuma is morphologically very similar to Solanum cerasiferum and more superficially similar to other species with straight prickles and acute to obtuse leaf lobes, including the African highland Solanum dasyphyllum Schumach. & Thonn. (Solanaceae Source 2011) and Solanum robustum H.Wendl. of the New World (see Nee 1999). It is not sympatric with any of those species, so confusion is only possible in the herbarium. Solanum umtuma can be distinguished from Solanum cerasiferum by its cuneate to truncate leaf bases (versus short-attenuate leaf bases in Solanum cerasiferum), ovate foliaceous calyx lobes 7-10 mm long on long-styled flowers (versus deltate to long-deltate membranous calyx lobes 4-7 mm long on long-styled flowers in Solanum cerasiferum), and the densely spiny calyx of long-styled flowers with ca. 30-80 prickles at anthesis (versus flower calyces with only 0-20 prickles at anthesis in Solanum cerasiferum). Solanum dasyphyllum and Solanum robustum both have leaf blades that are markedly attenuate on the petiole and decurrent onto the stem, the stems are usually somewhat winged from these decurrent leaf bases. Solanum umtuma is sympatric with Solanum lichtensteinii and differs from it by its obtuse to acute leaf lobes (versus rounded leaf lobes in Solanum lichtensteinii).

wfo-0001339613,"Lycianthes venturana is known from limited material from which mature fruit size and color, seed type, and corolla color and shape cannot be exactly ascertained. It is morphologically similar and most likely related to the species of series Tricolores (Dean et al. 2017). Of those species, it is most similar to L. jalicensis E,Dean in being nearly glabrous thoughout, especially on the calyx and corolla, but it is distinguished from that species by having a smaller calyx as well as being geographically disjunct. The corolla is likely white and probably has greenish coloration along veins of the lobes on the abaxial side. Whether or not the corolla has the small greenish spots or glands present in related species, such as L. tricolor (Dun.) Bitter is not known, because they do not persist well on pressed material, and the information is not included in label data. The fruits of the type specimen are dark in color, usually apiculate, 6 mm long and 4 mm wide. Whether these fruits are mature is not known. The apiculate tip to the fruits is formed from the persistent base of the style (Dean et al. 2017).
"
wfo-1000005226,"Lycianthes mariovelizii belongs to series Tricolores and is distinguished from most of the other species in the series by long calyx appendages (to 11 mm in flower and 14 mm in fruit) that are somewhat flattened and relatively wide at the base (appearing very flattened when dried). Within a calyx, the appendages often vary in length, but at least some of the appendages on a calyx are greater than 7 mm long and 1 mm wide at the base (Dean et al. 2018). The only species in series Tricolores with appendages similarly long and wide is L. surotatensis Gentry, a species with glandular trichomes. Within the series, L. mariovelizii is most similar to L. arrazolensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter, L. jalicensis E.Dean, and L. surotatensis, three species with which L. mariovelizii shares the following characters: unnotched seeds, white corollas, and occurrence mostly below 1000 m (Dean et al. 2020). Lycianthes mariovelizii differs from L. surotatensis by eglandular trichomes. It differs from L. arrazolensis and L. jalicensis by longer calyx appendages inserted < 0.5 mm below the calyx rim, versus > 0.5 mm. The appendages of L. arrazolensis are typically < 2.5 mm long, rarely reaching 5 mm in Guerrero; those of L. jalicensis are typically < 5 mm long. Also, the calyx and corolla of L. jalicensis are usually glabrous or nearly so, whereas those of L. mariovelizii are pubescent (Dean et al. 2020). "
wfo-0001022224,"This species is very similar to Lycianthes tricolor (Dun.) Bitter. It can be easily distinguished from L. tricolor by seed shape. The seeds of L. tricolor have a definite sharp notch that is usually deeper than 0.5 mm, whereas the seeds of L. arrazolensis lack this notch. In some Mexican L. arrazolensis populations in the states of Morelos and México, the seeds are shallowly indented on one side, but this indentation is less than 0.5 mm and usually less than 0.25 mm, and never sharply notched. Non-fruiting specimens can be challenging to identify. If a specimen was collected below 1700 m in elevation, it is most likely to be Lycianthes arrazolensis. In addition, the following non-seed characters can be helpful: the calyx rim of L. arrazolensis tends to be more prominent, often protruding beyond the appendage insertion by over 0.5 mm, while the calyx rim of L. tricolor is usually less than 0.5 mm; the appendages of L. arrazolensis tend to bend away from the rim, exposing the rim, while the appendages of L. tricolor are oriented closer to the rim and corolla, hiding the rim; the pores of the short stamens in L. arrazolensis usually face away from the style, while those of L. tricolor usually face toward the style; the pedicels of the oldest, largest flowers and the pedicels of the most mature fruits of L. arrazolensis are usually shorter than those of L. tricolor, although there is overlap in this characteristic; and the leaves of typical L. arrazolensis tend to have obvious geminate leaf pairs with elliptic to obovate laminas and leaf bases often attenuate into the petiole, while in L. tricolor the small geminate leaf often abscises early, and the laminas are more ovate with a less-attenuate leaf base. There is a wide range of morphological variation within Lycianthes arrazolensis as circumscribed here, especially in leaf size, leaf shape, and density of pubescence. This is particularly true of populations in the state of Oaxaca and neighboring Guerrero where small-leaved forms with very dense pubescence as well as large-leaved forms with sparse pubescence are found. The populations with larger leaves and sparser pubescence are usually found below 1,500 m, while those with denser pubescence are usually found above 2,000 m. The degree of variation found in this species is worthy of more study.

wfo-0001022556,"This species is very similar to Lycianthes arrazolensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter. It can be distinguished by seed shape. The seeds of L. tricolor have a definite sharp notch that is usually deeper than 0.5 mm, whereas the seeds of L. arrazolensis lack this notch. In some Mexican L. arrazolensis populations in the states of Morelos and México, the seeds are shallowly indented on one side, but this indentation is less than 0.5 mm and usually less than 0.25 mm, and never sharply notched (Dean et al. 2017). Non-fruiting specimens can be challenging to identify. The following non-seed characters can be helpful: the calyx rim of L. arrazolensis tends to be more prominent, often protruding beyond the appendage insertion by over 0.5 mm, while the calyx rim of L. tricolor is usually less than 0.5 mm; the appendages of L. arrazolensis tend to bend away from the rim, exposing the rim, while the appendages of L. tricolor are oriented closer to the rim and corolla, hiding the rim; the pores of the short stamens in L. arrazolensis usually face away from the style, while those of L. tricolor usually face toward the style; the flowering pedicels of L. tricolor are usually 13-33 mm long, becoming much longer in fruit, while those of L. arrazolensis are usually less than 15 mm in flower and 21 mm in fruit (however shorter pedicels in L. tricolor are found in Guatemala and Chiapas); and the leaves of typical L. arrazolensis tend to have obvious geminate leaf pairs with elliptic to obovate laminas and leaf bases often attenuate into the petiole, while in L. tricolor the small geminate leaf often abscises early, and the laminas are more ovate with a less-attenuate leaf base (Dean et al. 2017).

wfo-0001022485,"Lycianthes porteriana is a poorly understood and infrequently collected species with a narrow distribution. It is very closely related to Lycianthes multiflora Bitter and Lycianthes howardiana D'Arcy. It differs from those two species in its enlarged,scarious calyx margin (to 3 mm long in flower and 4 mm long in fruit vs. to 2 mm long in flower and fruit in the other two species). Lycianthes porteriana can also have very long, slender calyx appendages (to 11 mm long in flower vs to 4 (6) mm long in L. multiflora). The calyx appendages of L. porteriana are often narrower than those in L. howardiana (to 0.5-1 mm wide in L. porteriana vs. to 1-2 mm wide in L. howardiana). Further study is needed to better understand the relationship of these three species.

wfo-0001031618,"Solanum symonii has been confused with S. simile for most of its history. It shares with that species green mature fruit, medium plant size and relatively small flower size (for the clade). Crosses have been made between Solanum symonii and the diploid species S. vescum and S. aviculare and the other tetraploid species S. laciniatum and S. linearifolium (summarized in Symon, 1994), although most crosses involving this species were unsuccessful."
wfo-0001031714,"Solanum tetramerum is very similar to S. microphyllum, also found on the island of Hispaniola, but differs from that species in its foliose calyx without regular lobes, its prickles that are not paired at the nodes and in its generally larger leaf size. Individual specimens are easy to distinguish using calyx lobe morphology; S. tetramerum has foliose lobes and S. microphyllum narrowly triangular lobes. "
wfo-0001022497,"Lycianthes rantonnetii is a popular horticultural plant, often flowering prolifically throughout the year (depending on climate) and dying back to near the ground in cold temperatures. The species is widely planted in Mexico and California. Viable seeds are produced in Mexican plants, but in California, the fruits are often sterile, without viable seeds; it has been documented as persisting in the wild in southern California, but it is unknown whether viable seeds are being produced. The species was named for M. Victor Rantonnet, 19th century French horticulturist of Hyères, a town on the Mediterranean coast of southern France. The spelling of the epithet was first published as rantonnei and changed to rantonnetii by Lescuyer. Retaining the spelling as Lycianthes rantonnetii was upheld by recent editors of the International Plants Name Index citing Art. 60.7 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In Asia, it is the only species that has stone cells in the berries, but in cultivation it rarely sets fruit. It can easily be distinguished from all native species by its rotate corollas with copious interpetalar tissue, orange-yellow anthers that are slightly curved and angled, and somewhat striped stems. Lycianthes rantonnetii has variable length calyx appendages like L. schizocalyx, but the two species are not easy to confuse; L. schizocalyx has small bright red berries without stone cells whereas L. rantonnetii rarely sets fruit in cultivation, but, when it does, the berries are dirty yellow and have copious stone cells. In Asia I have only seen specimens of L. rantonnetii from India and Pakistan, but I would expect it to be in cultivation anywhere in subtropical areas of Asia.

wfo-0001022356,"Lycianthes hortulana is a shrub to vine of the cloud forests of Honduras and El Salvador. It is morphologically similar and probably closely related to Lycianthes breedlovii E.Dean of Chiapas (Dean et al. 2019). Both species are shrubs to vines with zigzag branching due to widely divaricate branching angles, yellow to orange multangulate-stellate pubescence with branched rays, and white flowers with violet markings (Dean et al. 2019). The two species are isolated from one another, with no populations of either species known to occur in Guatemala. They have diverged from one another in pedicel length (L. breedlovii flowers have pedicels 9-16 mm long vs 3-9 mm long), flower size (L. breedlovii has corollas that are vs 0.9-1.5 cm long vs 0.6-1 cm long), corolla pubescence (L. breedlovii has very dense pubescence on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes vs sparse), and stamen length (L. breedlovii has unequal stamens vs equal). There are two specimens (Molina 32218 and Molina 31610) not included in this species description, because they have exceptionally long appendages in fruit (8 mm) and are from lower elevation (1200-1300 m) than normal. One of these specimens (Molina 31610) is from Nicaragua and the label describes red fruit (rather than orange), and the other (Molina 32218) is from Honduras. A third specimen not included is Soihet M. 171 (from Honduras) which matches other material of the species but says it is from 950 m in elevation and dry subtropical forest.
"
wfo-0001022478,"Lycianthes pilifera is extremely variable in terms of width of leaves, size of flowers and calyx appendages, as well as amount of pubescence. The type material has nearly glabrous, relatively narrow leaves and relatively short calyx appendages. Morphological forms with longer calyx appendages are found in Oaxaca below 2000 m, and forms with shorter appendages are found above that elevation. Very small-leaved, small-flowered, and small-fruited forms have been collected from near Conception Papalo, Oaxaca, at 2700 m (Dean et al. 2020). This species has been sometimes confused with L. stephanocalyx (Brandegee) Bitter and L. quichensis (Coult. & Donn. Sm.) Bitter, both of which have one- to two-flowered inflorescences and flowers with equal stamens. Unlike L. pilifera, both of those species have red fruits. Lycianthes quichensis is only found in Chiapas and Guatemala and does not overlap in distribution with L. pilifera. Lycianthes stephanocalyx does overlap in distribution with L. pilifera and differs in having red fruit, connate anthers, which are usually yellow, and small whitish curved trichomes. Lycianthes pilifera also resembles L. caeciliae, an endemic of Veracruz, in having purple flowers with equal stamens and dark purple fruit with large, dark seeds, however L. caeciliae differs in having dark purple, stellate corollas and dark purple anthers (Dean et al. 2020).

wfo-0001022494,"Lycianthes quichensis is an attractive shrub that horticulturalists are trying to bring into cultivation and is sometimes available in seed catalogues. It has relatively large purple flowers with distinctive dark purple and green markings and widely ovate leaves. It has sometimes been confused with L. pilifera (Benth.) Bitter, a species of Oaxaca, Mexico. The two species differ in fruit color (L. pilifera has purple-black fruit) and pubescence (the trichomes of L. pilifera are darker and more tubular-conical upon drying than those of L. quichensis are pale yellow to white and flattened upon drying).
"
wfo-0001031698,"Solanum tepuiense is related to S. nudum, a widespread species of Central and northern South America. It differs from S. nudum in its larger flowers and strongly winged stems. The internodes in the type collection are very short and are perhaps a distinctive feature of S. tepuiense, but may instead be related to habitat and thus not consistent. The trichomes of S. tepuiense are quite different from those of S. nudum in being composed of many small cells. The cells appear bead-like and are generally square in shape. The trichomes of S. nudum are composed of two or three elongate cells and are often branched."
wfo-0001030699,"Solanum pycnanthemum, as delimited here, is a shrubby plant with ovate-elliptic to ovate-lanceolate leaves that are strongly decurrent onto the petiole, corymbose inflorescences of more than 30 flowers, villous or lanate indument over the entire plant composed of sessile and stalked trichomes with elongate midpoints and reduced rays, and a large purple corolla. Specimens of Solanum pycnanthemum have been misidentified as S. decompositiflorum, a species also occurring in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Solanum decompositiflorum has larger leaves (sometimes also decurrent onto the petiole), a villous indument of glandular porrect stellate trichomes with a smaller midpoint and smaller, white flowers (2-2.5 cm in diameter). The calyx of S. decompositiflorum is fused for much of its length and the lobes are very short and cuspidate to subtruncate, rather than foliaceous, as are those of S. pycnanthemum. The berry of S. pycnanthemum is half the size of that of S. decompositiflorum, 1 versus 2 cm in diameter. "
wfo-0001339614,"Lycianthes michaelneei is a member of series Tricolores (Dean et al., 2020) and was provisionally identified as L. pilosissima (M.Martens & Galeotti) Bitter (a synonym of L. tricolor (Dun.) Bitter) in the Flora of Veracruz (Nee 1986). Lycianthes michaelneei is similar to L. tricolor in having notched seeds. It differs from L. tricolor in having an entirely purple corolla (lobes and membrane) rather than a white membrane with some purple on the lobes, and it may lack the green, glandular spots on the corolla (although more fieldwork is needed to determine this). In general, this species is more robust than similar species such as L. tricolor and L. arrazolensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter. Another distinctive difference is the matted stem trichomes, which are not found in closely related species (Dean et al. 2020).

wfo-0001022234,"Lycianthes barbatula is related to L. manantlanensis Aa.Rodr. & O.Vargas and L. orogenes Standl. & Steyerm. with which it shares relatively thick leaves (thick chartaceous to coriaceous), relatively glabrous foliage, long, delicate, arching pedicels, white corollas, and equal to nearly equal stamens with yellow and brown anthers. Lycianthes barbatula differs from the other two species in having longer calyx appendages and tufts of trichomes in the vein axils along the midvein of the abaxial side of the leaf blade. The fruit color of L. barbatula has been recorded on several specimen labels as being white, and this is also the color given in Gentry & Standley (1974), but there is uncertainty as to whether this is the final color at maturity or a transitional color, as other specimens mention blue-grey or blue-purple fruits.
"
wfo-0001022292,"Lycianthes connata is a very distinctive species due to the structure of its calyx which has a very long, sleeve-like margin and appendages that are connate at their bases that are reflexed in fruit. The only species that can be confused with Lycianthes connata are L. ceratocalycia (Donn.Sm.) Bitter and L. gongylodes J.L.Gentry, both of which have stems that compress upon drying and short, bulging appendages that can give a somewhat similar appearance to the calyx. Lycianthes ceratocalycia differs in having stellate, purple corollas, equal stamens, and young stems with scurfy, horizontal lines; L. gongylodes differs in having equal stamens and stems that are moderately pubescent with curling trichomes. Lycianthes connata was originally described from Guatemala, and has been collected often in Chiapas. There are fewer collections from high elevation Oaxaca in the Sierra de Juarez. The Oaxacan populations are very like the Chiapas populations except that the calyx appendages are notably shorter, making the calyx look more like that of L. gongylodes or L. ceratocalycia.

wfo-0001022465,"Lycianthes orogenes is an undercollected species of cloud forests in Chiapas and Guatemala that is closely related to Lycianthes manantlanensis Aarón Rodr. & O.Vargas and Lycianthes barbatula Standl. & Steyerm., with which it shares slender, elongate pedicels and white flowers. Lycianthes orogenes has calyx appendages that are intermediate in length between the two other species, and it lacks the trichomes in the leaf axils that are present in Lycianthes barbatula. Although the mature fruits have been reported in the literature as green (Rodriguez & Vargas, 2002; Gentry & Standley, 1974), they are reported as purple on specimen labels, and the immature fruits are green. Specimens of L. manantlanensis from some areas of Guatemala and El Salvador have sometimes been misidentified as L. orogenes.

wfo-0001028548,"This species has not been collected since 1880. Modern collections often determined as this species are actually S. pseudopedunculatum. Smith (1991) misapplied the name S. inamoenum to S. pseudopedunculatum. However, the two species are not particularly similar, the species differing notably in density of leaf pubescence and inflorescence structure. Considerable confusion has surrounded the distinctiveness of S. inamoenum from S. austro-caledonicum from New Caledonia and S. tetrandrum from Australia. While S. austro-caledonicum, S. inamoenum, S. milnei, and S. vanuatuense form a species complex, none are closely related to S. tetrandrum. See the discussion of S. austro-caledonicum for a discussion of this complex.

wfo-0001028299,"Solanum harmandii is a stout shrub that is morphologically very different from all the other spiny solanums treated here. The growth form is reminiscent of members of the Brevantherum clade (sensu Gagnon et al. 2022), but it possesses copious prickles and in flower morphology it is a typical spiny solanum with tapering anthers opening by distally directed pores. Solanum giganteum of the Indian subcontinent has similar overall morphology, with many-branched inflorescences, but differs from S. harmandii in its scurfy white pubescence of multangulate trichomes and entire leaves that are usually almost glabrous adaxially."
wfo-0001026632,"Solanum borgmannii is known only from the type specimen, which lacks ecological data and fruits. It has been collected at one of the highest altitudes recorded for Solanum in New Guinea. In the absence of more details, especially its fruits, it affinities remain unsure, but would seem to have distant affinities with S. cinereum from eastern Australia."
wfo-0001028399,"All eleven of the specific level names for this species here treated in synonymy were published by Harold St. John. It was recognized as two varieties of S. incompletum by Hillebrand (1888). There are differences among the specimens some corresponding with Hillebrand's varieties, but intermediate forms exist. St. John (1969) elevated these two varieties to species, S. hillebrandii and S. haleakalaense. Since both names were published at the same time, either name could be used for the single taxon. I chose to use S. hillebrandii for two reasons: first, to honor William Hillebrand for his major contribution to Hawaiian botany; second, since the species was not restricted to Mount Halaekala. With some reservations, I include S. nesophilum within S. hillebrandii. St. John (1988) named S. nesophilum from a single specimen and although it differs from other specimens of S. hillebrandii in a number of ways, most notably the density of its pubescence, the wide range of variation in S. hillebrandii makes me inclined to consider it an aberrant individual. "
wfo-0001022486,"The calyx of Lycianthes pringlei, with its undulate margin that may appear bilabiate and poorly developed appendages which often appear as elongated dark bumps, is uncommon in the genus. This feature, in combination with the very glandular pubescence and reddish-orange ovoid fruits, differentiate this shrub from all other species of Lycianthes (Dean et al. 2020).

wfo-0001022357,"Lycianthes howardiana is morphologically similar and probably closely related to L. multiflora Bitter and L. porteriana D’Arcy. It differs from those two species in its very wide, densely pubescent calyx appendages (1-2 mm wide in L. howardiana vs to 0.5-1 mm wide in L. porteriana and L. multiflora). Lycianthes porteriana also differs from L. howardiana in its enlarged,scarious calyx margin (to 3 mm long in flower and 4 mm long in fruit vs. to 2 mm long in flower and fruit in the other two species). "
wfo-0001022209,"Lycianthes acidochondra, a Panamanian endemic, is closely related to Lycianthes pauciflora (Vahl) Bitter and Lycianthes tysoniana D'Arcy. All three species have a fleshy (often urceolate) flowering calyx that is difficult to cut open when dried, calyx appendages that in flower are often oblanceolate and wide at the tip, multangulate stellate trichomes, entire whitish corollas, and unequal stamens. Both L. acidochondra and L. tysoniana differ from L. pauciflora in having a calyx that thickens in fruit, resembling a baseball glove that enfolds the base of the berry. Lycianthes acidochondra differs from L. tysoniana in the texture of the trichomes and the appearance of the leaf veins. In L. acidochondra, the stellate trichomes are fine-textured with the narrow rays often crisped, and the leaf veins are not prominent. In L. tysoniana the trichomes are much thicker in texture, the pointed rays never crisped, and the leaf veins are very prominent. Lycianthes acidochondra has two sclerotic granules at the tip of the mature fruit that can reach a length of 5 mm long and are dolobriform to cruciform in shape. In his treatment of Lycianthes acidochondra in Flora of Panama, D'Arcy (1973 [1974]) references Georg Bitter's statement in the protologue for Solanum acidochondrum (Bitter, 1914a) that the sclerotic granules found in this species are the largest he has seen. Bitter also illustrated the granules in one of his papers on the fruit morphology of the Solanaceae (Bitter, 1914b). The circumscription of Lycianthes acidochondra presented here includes the Panamanian specimens that D'Arcy (1973) placed in Lycianthes guianensis (Dunal) Bitter, a species first described from French Guyana in 1852 (Dunal, 1852). D'Arcy (1973 [1974]) distinguished the two species by calyx appendage length, with specimens with appendages less than 4 mm long placed in L. acidochondra and specimens with appendages more than 4 mm long placed in L. guianensis. In his key to species, D'Arcy (1973 [1974]) indicates that both species have woody calyx appendages in fruit. The material we are placing in L. acidochondra is uniform in habit, trichome type, leaf shape (the thick chartaceous to subcoriaceous leaves usually with blunt to widely acute tips), and floral characteristics, with appendage length in flower ranging from the shorter lengths present on the type specimen to 7 mm long. The material is cohesive geographically as well. If our Panamanian material of L. acidochondra is conspecific with L. guianensis, the latter name with take precedence, however the use of the name L. guianensis is problematic at this time, because Benítez de Rojas and D'Arcy (1997) synonymized the name L. guianensis with the name L. pauciflora (Vahl) Bitter. In addition, a type specimen has yet to be designated for the name L. guianensis. Examination of the image of one putative syntype for the name L. guianensis (at BM) reveals that the specimen may very well have a woody calyx that wraps around the base of the berry. This type of fruiting calyx is not present in type material of L. pauciflora. For all the above reasons, we are electing to use the name L. acidochondra for this Panamanian material at this time.

wfo-0001022457,"Lycianthes nitida is a relatively common and widely distributed (southern Mexico through Central America) epiphytic herb or shrub with calyces lacking appendages, purple, stellate corollas, and equal stamens. Its distinctive shiny, glabrous, coriaceous leaves, in which the geminate leaf pairs are of very different shapes and sizes (the smaller leaf much shorter and rounder than the larger) makes this species difficult to confuse with similar species that lack calyx appendages, such as Lycianthes heteroclita (Sendtn.) Bitter and Lycianthes synanthera (Sendtn.) Bitter. Lycianthes nitida may be confused with Lycianthes anomala Bitter, another epiphyte with stellate corollas and equal stamens, but L. anomala has short appendages on its calyx and tufts of trichomes in the vein axils of the underside of the leaves.
"
wfo-0001026895,"Solanum cassioides is probably closely related to S. trachytrichium, also from southeastern Brazil and adjacent Argentina. It shares with that species the hooked trichomes with mound-like multicellular bases on the leaf surfaces (see Fig. 9C in Knapp, 2002). In S. cassioides these trichomes are usually confined to the leaf margins, but in some collections are found on the adaxial leaf surfaces. Solanum trachytrichium has these trichomes over the entire leaf surface. The two species also share large, campanulate flowers and difoliate, non-geminate sympodial units. Bitter (1919a) created subsection Silicosolanum for Solanum trachytrichium based on the rough feel of the leaves, but the two taxa here are not distinct enough from the rest of the S. nudum species group to warrant such separation."
wfo-0001030180,"Solanum palmillae is superficially very similar to S. imberbe (S. deflexiflorum species group) of eastern Panama and northern South America, S. monadelphum of eastern Peru and Brazil, and S. amnicola (S. arboreum species group) of eastern Peru. All of these species have narrow, willow-like leaves and branched inflorescences. The similarity most probably is due to convergent habitat; these are species growing in the bottoms of, and along, swift-flowing watercourses which often flood. Solanum palmillae is most closely related to S. rovirosanum, also of Mexico, and may be derived from that species (Knapp, 1991b)."
wfo-0001026424,"Solanum aviculare is easily confused with S. laciniatum, herbarium specimens without fruit or annotations as to fruit colour can be difficult to identify. Baylis (1954) first identified the difference between these species. Solanum aviculare is diploid, with orange or red mature fruit, and about 600 seeds per fruit; S. laciniatum is tetraploid, with green mature frutis, and ca. 200 seeds per fruit. Both of these species have a long history of cultivation for horticulture and for alkaloids, with industry developed in the ex-Soviet Union, Australia and New Zealand (summarized in Symon, 1994). None of these industries have persisted, due perhaps to variability in supplies, alkaloid content or to lack of demand after the development of synthetic production. Crosses have been made between S. aviculare and the diploid species S. linearifolium, S. vescum and S. simile and the tetraploid species S. laciniatum and S. symonii (summarized in Symon, 1994). Solanum aviculare may be one of the diploid parents of the tetraploid species S. laciniatum (and perhaps also S. multivenosum) with S. vescum (Symon, 1994), but these hypotheses have not been tested using molecular methods."
wfo-0001026317,"I excluded Solanum argentinum from section Geminata based on its complex, branched inflorescence, and thought it possibly was more closely related to members of section Holophylla s.s. such as S. aligerum Schltdl. (Knapp, 2002). Analyses of chloroplast DNA sequences (Bohs, 2005) show that S. argentinum is firmly imbedded in the Geminata clade, and that it is apparently close to S. pseudocapsicum L. and its relatives. Closer analysis of inflorescence morphology revealed that S. argentinum lacks the distinctive platform pedicel base morphology of S. aligerum and relatives (see Knapp, 1989), and that the inflorescence, despite its highly branched character, is similar to those elsewhere in the Geminata clade. Solanum argentinum shares with other members of the S. pseudocapsicum species group (sensu Knapp, 2002) brightly colored fruit with red or orange pericarp, yellow, flattened seeds, and pedicels that are nodding in flower and erect in fruit. Individual plants of S. argentinum vary enormously in pubescence density, from nearly glabrous to densely pubescent over the entire abaxial leaf surface. This variability in pubescence density led to the description of the two taxa now synonymized under S. argentinum, and is not different in anything other than degree (Rigonatto et al., 2005). Rigonatto et al. (2005) examined trichome and leaf surface morphology along the range of pubescence densities and found no differences that would lead them to regard them as different taxa, even at the subspecific level. Puebescence density may also vary in response to environmental variables such as aridity or elevation. To test this possibility I scored mature leaves (four leaves below the growing tip of a shoot) into three classes of pubescence density on 160 geo-referenced specimens with elevation recorded (see Knapp, 2007) from throughout the species range. Each duplicate of a given collection was scored separately, as some collections were obviously not from the same plant (i.e. they were very different in pubescence density). The scoring was a simple three point scale: 1 = glabrous, 2 = tufts of trichomes in the vein axils, 3 = pubescence on the entire lamina. No effect of latitude, longitude or altitude was apparent and the confidence limits of each pubescence class overlapped for each environmental variable (see Knapp, 2007). Local populations of S. argentinum are often composed of large continuous patches of plants of identical pubescence density. My observations of populations in eastern Bolivia (e.g. Nee et al. 51722, 51723) suggest to me that the species may be clonal, or spreading through underground connections. This, however, has not yet been investigated. "
wfo-0001032494,"Solanum warmingii is related to S. caavurana. It shares with S. caavurana petaloid calyx lobes, large elliptic buds, and fleshy flowers. Solanum warmingii is easily distinguished from S. caavurana by its nearly glabrous leaves that dry pale sea-green or yellowish, its longer fruiting pedicels that are slightly expanded at the apex, and its winged stem. The large flowers and petaloid calyx lobes of S. warmingii are distinctive and make this species easy to identify. Solanum warmingii is a species of limited distribution, and very few collections exist. The habitat of S. warmingii is cerrado or campo limpo, both types of savannah vegetation. It often grows as a small tree at the edge of pastures."
wfo-0001030170,"Solanum palinacanthum is easily recognized by its perennial underground rootstocks, dense uniform short glandular pubescence of the stems and inflorescences, large blue or purple flowers and often nearly truncate calyx. The only other species of sect. Acanthophora with large blue flowers, large seeds and fruits is S. mammosum which is scarcely sympatric and which is almost shaggy-pilose and has much longer and narrowly lanceolate calyx lobes. Morton (1976) used the names S. claviceps Griseb. and S. aenictum C. V. Morton, for plants in the northwestern and northeastern extremes of Argentina, respectively. However, these were just the two areas widely separated areas of Argentina where the species occurs, and when the whole range is examined, it is evident that a single, easily recognized, but somewhat variable species is found. The variability is mainly in the indumentum on the upper surface of the leaves. In most populations it consists of simple hairs, typical of sect. Acanthophora. However, in some populations these simple hairs are mixed with stellate hairs with vestigial rays, while in many populations in the Cerrado region of central Brazil, the upper surface of the leaves is densely stellate-tomentose with well-developed stellate hairs. This variability in hair types is similar to that in S. incarceratum Ruiz & Pav., of a different group within sect. Acanthophora (Nee, 1999), and the stellate-tomentose extreme occurs in the same general area. In both species the variability is continuous and no infraspecific taxa should be recognized."
wfo-0001026851,"The species is one of the most easily recognized and least variable in sect. Acanthophora. The large bright orange-red fruit and large straw colored seeds maintain their bright colors in all but the most poorly preserved herbarium specimens. The leaves are distinctive, appearing glabrous but for the sparse silky hairs; it is the only species in the section, and to my knowledge in subgen. Leptostemonum, without stellae on any part of the plant. The calyx with stout spines from enlarged, almost bulbous bases is distinctive in the section. It could be confused with extremes of S. atropurpureum which have shallowly lobed leaves, but this latter species has much smaller yellow fruits and yellowish rather than white corollas as well as stellae (even if only a few and confined to the base of the sinuses) on the underside of the leaf. Solanum aculeatissimum with which it has often been unnecessarily confused, is easily distinguished by the non-winged seeds, more copious glandular pubescence, and the presence of stellae on the underside of the leaf. It is found sporadically in both western and eastern tropical Africa, and may be increasing in distribution; it is apparently often introduced from cultivation. Solanum capsicoides can be easily distinguished from other similar species by its large (to 3.5 cm in diameter) bright orange fruit with winged seeds; S. aculeatissimum and S. viarum have smaller fruits that are yellowish green at maturity and have unwinged seeds. Solanum mammosum has larger, irregularly shaped fruits usually (in Africa) with 4-5 protuberances at the base, unwinged seeds and purple flowers. Both S. capsicoides and S. mammosum have a spongy fruit mesocarp. Solanum capsicoides has some peculiarities which would seem to adapt it to the naturally disturbed habitats of the sandy restingas. It is a a lower growing, more spreading species than its erect and single-stemmed relatives of mesic and wooded habitats such as S. acerifolium or S. atropurpureum. Winged seeds are probably an adaptation to local wind or water dispersal after passing of the seeds by birds in these relatives with small juicy berries. The seeds have become much broader in S. capsicoides and it is significant that they not only are blown around more easily than those of S. atropurpureum but that they also float for a few days. There seems no longer to be any provision for animal dispersal of the fruits of S. capsicoides since they regularly are found on herbarium specimens in the mature state; they are nearly dry at maturity and split irregularly to permit the seeds to escape in a not very effective shaker mechanism. The development (or retention?) of the striking bright orange-red color of the fruits in this context is difficult to explain. 
"
wfo-0001031503,"Solanum stuckertii is most similar to S. luteoalbum and S. hibernum. All three species have stellate corollas and persistent showy orangish fruits with large angled seeds. Solanum stuckertii can be distinguished from S. luteoalbum by its indumentum of exclusively unbranched hairs and its white corollas. Solanum stuckertii is found in southern Bolivia to central Argentina, whereas S. luteoalbum occurs in Ecuador and Peru. Solanum hibernum differs in having purple corollas and a dense covering of dendritically branched hairs on the abaxial leaf surfaces. In Bolivia, S. hibernum is generally found in the arid vegetation of interandean valleys, whereas S. stuckertii occurs in lowland Chaco vegetation, and thus the two species may be separated by ecogeographic differences. "
wfo-0001030582,"The resemblance of S. pseudoauriculatum to species of Solanum sect. Brevantherum is striking, and gave rise to the erroneous comparison by Chodat and Hassler with S. auriculatum Ait. (=S. mauritianum Scop.) of that section. However, the species definitely belongs in subgenus Leptostemonum because of the very narrow and attenuate anther; and the stellae are more typical of those of Leptostemonum than they are to all but a handful of species of sect. Brevantherum, most of which have stellae of much more complicated structure. Although the available herbarium specimens are without prickles, the young plants or sprouts very likely will be seen to be armed with prickles when living plants can be examined. Solanum pseudoauriculatum occupies an area in the southwestern distribution of S. paniculatum, but the latter species has leaves which are much more consistently and often deeply lobed and which are nearly glabrous and shiny by the time they are full size. It is also found in the southwestern distribution of S. scuticum, but that species has more consistently lateral inflorescences that are borne on difoliate sympodial units."
wfo-0001032367,"Solanum viarum is most easily distinguished by the initially dense puberulence of the ovary. The hairs are often difficult to see but usually persist until the expanding fruit is about 5 mm in diameter, when they are scattered over the surface. Care must be taken not to mistake these for miscellaneous loose hairs which often become stuck to the young fruits of this and related species. The largely sympatric S. palinacanthum is the only other species of sect. Acanthophora to have a puberulent (as opposed to minutely stipitate-glandular) ovary, but this perennial species is easily distinguished by its larger purple flowers and large fruits and seeds. Solanum viarum is similar to S. myriacanthum and S. aculeatissimum and the three species form a closely related complex (Nee, 1979, 1999). Solanum myriacanthum, however, is a Central American species and is not sympatric with S. viarum and S. aculeatissimum. Solanum viarum and S. aculeatissimum are sympatric in Brazil, but with only a few exceptions, do not appear to intergrade (Nee, 1979). In AfricaSolanum viarum can be difficult to distinguish from S. aculeatissimum, the more common of the two species in Africa; S. viarum has deltate, versus long-triangular calyx lobes, a puberulent (rather than stipitate-glandular) ovary, and more uniform, fine glandular pubescence on the stems and new growth. The stem prickles of S. viarum are often somewhat curved and all the same size, while those of S. aculeatissimum are straight and of varying lengths. Solanum viarum and S. aculeatissimum are the two most common introduced species in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is interesting that S. aculeatissimum is common in Africa, while S. viarum is more common in Asia; it has become widely naturalized in south China and throughout India, where both species were previously known as S. khasianum (see Babu & Hepper 1979 for an account of the confusion in this group, their misinterpretations were corrected by Nee 1979). We have seen more specimens of S. viarum from West Africa (and a few from coastal South Africa), but it may be that the range of this species is increasing in Africa. Care in identifying specimens as S. aculeatissimum and S. viarum will be needed in order to track the spread of the latter. Solanum viarum was introduced to the southern United States in the late 20th century and is becoming a noxious weed there (Mullahey et al. 1998) due to its short juvenile period and its spread by livestock.

"
wfo-0001029340,"Solanum mammosum is widely cultivated for its unusual fruits that are usually teat-shaped with an apical nipple and basal lobes. It is a member of the Acanthophora clade (Levin et al. 2005), of which three other species are also found escaped in Africa (S. aculeatissimum, S. capsicoides, S. viarum). Solanum mammosum is probably native to the Caribbean and Central and South America (Nee 1979), but is now widespread worldwide in cultivation. Solanum mammosum can be distinguished from other species in section Acanthophora by the combination of its purple corollas, long copious pubescence, and its usually bizarre nipple-shaped fruit. It is most similar to S.palinacanthum, which also has purple corollas, but which has short glandular puberulence and exclusively globose fruits. The morphological and geographical reasons for considering this species native to northern South America and possibly the Caribbean have been discussed previously (Nee, 1979). Briefly, the globose fruit form is undoubtedly the primitive condition and is nearly confined to the Llanos of Venezuela and adjacent areas where the species seems well-adapted to the seasonally dry grassland climate. It is only rare and sporadic in Brazil south of the Amazon basin, the center of diversity of the section. Because of the widely acknowledged utility of its poisonous fruits in killing rats and cockroaches, it has been to a minor extent cultivated and spread. "
wfo-0001025896,"Solanum amotapense can be distinguished from the other species in the section by its inflated calyx tube, rotate-stellate corolla, long slender filaments, and subcordate leaf bases. The only other species of section Cyphomandropsis occurring in arid areas of northern Peru is S. hutchisonii. Solanum amotapense differs from it in its abundant pubescence and chartaceous rather than succulent leaf blades. All specimens of S. amotapense have unbranched eglandular hairs on the stems leaves, and inflorescences except the type collections of S. amotapense and C. villosa, which have a few dendritically branched hairs, especially on the leaf margins. Corolla color varies from white to light blue or purple in this species, and the style is puberulent rather than glabrous in the type of C. villosa."
wfo-0001028067,"This distinctive species has several unusual morphological characters not commonly found in the other species of section Cyphomandropsis, including pinnately compound leaves, fusiform fruits, and nearly complete lack of pubescence. Some species of Solanum section Pachyphylla exhibit these characters; Solanum fusiforme, however, completely lacks the swollen anther connective that defines section Pachyphylla and has stamens typical of section Cyphomandropsis. Solanum fusiforme is uncommon and restricted to southeastern Brazil and areas of adjacent Misiones, Argentina and Paraguay. Efforts should be made to relocate and preserve populations of this interesting species."
wfo-0001026305,"Solanum arenarium is probably most closely related to S. gnaphalocarpon, also of SE Brazil. It differs from that species in its strongly discolorous larger leaves, glabrous fruit, and smaller flowers. The trichomes of the lower leaf surface in S. arenarium are so closely packed so as to obscure the lamina. Label data indicate that the flowers of S. arenarium are pale green, while those of S. gnaphalocarpon, S. pseudodaphnopsis, S. smithii and S. tunariense are white."
wfo-0001027767,"Solanum eitenii shows a set of unique morphological characters. The 4- to many-forked inflorescences, the attenuate leaf blades, and the indument with porrect-stellate trichomes with a many-celled central ray are morphological similarities that suggest a probable relationship with S. decompositiflorum. and S. rhytidoandrum. Solanum eitenii, however, is readily distinguished from these two: in S. decompositiflorum the leaves are oval to oval-elliptic; the rachis of the inflorescence is shorter; the calyx has a longer tube with the sepals united near the apex and the lobes very short and cuspidate and without viscid indument; in S. rhytidoandrum the leaves are elliptic, the calyx lobes are linear-elliptic and acute to acuminate at the apex with tomentose external indument. "
wfo-0001347654,"This new species is similar to S. leptostachys both species having irregularly lobed leaves, usually unbranched inflorescences, violet to deep blue corollas, and upright fruits with a glandular-viscid surface However, S. leptostachys has ovate to ovate-elliptic leaf blades, velutinous on both surfaces, with a compact indumentum of multangulate or stellate long stalked trichomes, linear calyx lobes, and rotate-stellate corollas equal to or smaller than 1.8 cm in diameter, rotate-stellate with triangular apical lobes. Solanum mellobarretoi can be distinguished by its lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate leaves, campanulate calyces with ovate-lanceolate lobes, and corollas up to 5 cm in diameter, with the lobes cuspidate at the apex."
wfo-0001031143,"Solanum scuticum is the common weedy representative of sect. Torva throughout much of Brazil south of the Amazon; it is common in second growth, roadsides and pastures. Several widely distributed collections were identified as S. asperolanatum Ruiz & Pav., but that is a species of much higher elevations in the Andes, is more robust in all respects, especially the peduncle which is usually more than 3 cm long. This species is very similar to S. rudepannum in having very yellowish ferruginous inflorescences, stems and leaves. The calyx in bud stage, however, is much shorter and appears truncate, with lobes very short with only the caudate tip being obvious."
wfo-0001025737,"The dense whitish or slightly yellowish tomentum of the plant, especially the young parts is a good character to differentiate it from many other species of sect. Torva which have a ferruginous tomentum. The populations from Depto. Santa Cruz, Bolivia, have a dense, yellowish or whitish tomentum which gives the leaves and pedicels a thicker appearance than those in northern Bolivia. At one time it was thought that S. acutilobum was conspecific with S. crotonifolium, and they are very similar in most respects. However, the geographic disjunction coupled with the characters in the following key show them to be morphologically distinct and deserving of specific recognition. Despite the variability in the leaf size and lobing, there seems to be relatively little variation in S. acutilobum. Dunal astutely compared it with S. paniculatum L. of eastern Brazil and Paraguay, contrasting it by the persistently tomentose upper surface of the leaves in S. acutilobum, whereas those of S. paniculatum are glabrous. Much confusion has surrounded the type of S. acutilobum. Dunal mistook the word “Para” as an abbreviation for “Paraguay” when originally describing the species, but in later works he corrected this to “Para”, the old name for the city of Belém in the state of Pará, far outside the normal range of the species. The annotation “Leg. Ferreira ex Herb. Lusitanicus comm. Geoffroy” has been added to the type sheet in an unknown hand, indicating the specimen was collected by Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira (Daly, 1995). Ferreira explored the Brazilian Amazon beginning in 1783 entering through Pará at the mouth of the Amazon, and at one point travelled up the Rio Madeira to the Río Guaporé on the border between Rondônia, Brazil, and northeasternmost Bolivia, and thus through part of the main area of the species, and where the type likely was collected. Ferreira’s collections returned to Lisbon, Portugal, but in 1807 the country was invaded by Napoleon; and Etienne Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire was sent to “select” manuscripts and specimens to take back to the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Another sheet of Rusby 776 (WIS ex WELC 15079) is very different from the other and should not be considered an isotype of S. myrianthum; it possibly represents S. asperolanatum. The only collection from a much higher altitude in Bolivia is Depto. Santa Cruz, Prov. Caballero: at El Cristo statue in Comarapa, M. Nee 53652 (MO, NY); this surely is a waif as it is not found elsewhere in this region of arid inter-Andean valleys. 1. Fruit dull, apparently not turning orange, sparsely stellate in upper half, at least when young; corolla violet or purplish; seeds 1.5 × 1.2-1.3 mm; 200-1700 m, Colombia. S. crotonifolium 1. Fruit soon turning shiny, bright orange at maturity, glabrous at all stages; corolla white, more rarely with faint tinge of violet; seeds 1.7-2.2 × 1.4-1.8 mm; 125-1022 (-1850 as a waif) m, Bolivia, Brazil (Pará, Rondônia).S. acutilobum Solanum acutilobum is very common in sandy pastures and brushy places in the plains from Santa Cruz (Bolivia) originally with semi-deciduous, subtropical forests to northern Bolivia and adjacent Brazil in the periphery of the Amazon evergreen forest, and was probably adapted to the savannas and sandy floodplains of the rivers, but is now a common feature in disturbed habitats. Despite the numerous collections, there are no indications of uses and the only common name “espina” (Williams et al. 1070) sounds like an ad hoc designation. In the vicinity of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, it is sympatric with two other common species of sect. Torva, S. consimile and S. caricaefolium. The ranges of the latter two species overlap in this small area, and hybridization seems to occur; see the discussion under these two species. All three have remarkably similar small, bright orange, juicy berries, but S. acutilobum has not been seen to hybridize with the other two. However, it will hybridize with the locally very uncommon S. albidum, a primarily montane species which is now found in scattered localities on the alluvial plain. One such putative hybrid is from Depto. Santa Cruz, Prov. Santiesteban, 1.5 km SW of center of Montero, 17°21'S, 63°16'W, 295 m, 12 Jan 1987 (fl,fr), M. Nee 33441 (LPB, NY). Solanum albidum is a more robust plant with larger flowers, fruits and leaves; the leaves of S. albidum are strongly bicolorous with a glabrous shiny dark green upper surface."
wfo-0001027154,"Most species of spiny solanums, and perhaps most especially those of this group (the Solanum torvum group of Whalen, 1984 or section Torva Nees of Nee, 1999), are characterized by the leaves becoming progressively smaller and less lobed as the plant matures. Saplings and sprouts have deeply lobed, spiny leaves and often the flowering branches of older plants have much smaller, entire, and without prickles leaves, sometimes being easy to confuse with the without prickles subgenus Solanum. However, each species has a particular range of variation of leaf lobing. Solanum comarapanum has very tomentose, and unusually prominently lobed leaves except on the oldest or least vigorously growing material, and at least some of the lobes tend to be undulate. The herbarium specimens available have a widely divergent aspect because of this leaf lobing, but observations in the field and collections from individual plants demonstrate that they all belong to a single species. The very pubescent fruits are useful for identification, but apparently this is variable, as some collections, noticeably Nee & Saldias 36242 and Nee et al. 37413, have glabrescent fruits; fully mature fruits of this species are not yet known. The ferruginous color of the young growth, partly maintained in older plants, is obscured on many of the specimens as they were collected at the edge of the gravel highway and the dense tomentum has become covered with road dust. Etymology: The species is named after the town of Comarapa, the site of many collections of this species."
wfo-0001028696,"The description of S. iodotrichum is based on limited available material, and it will not be surprising if further study of the species in the field reveals currently undetected variation. In particular, very little is known about the mature berries. The species is a very distinctive one within the S. crinitipes complex, set apart by a combination of characters. Particularly characteristic of S. iodotrichum is the densely pilose vestiture, composed of simple hairs and stellae with elongate midpoints, the coarsely lobed or repand leaves, and the fruiting pedicels strongly recurved at base. The distinctive stellae with gland tipped midpoints are shared with S. glutinosum and the dense, acicular prickles with S. crinitipes, but the combination of these characters in S. iodotrichum is unique in the “crinitipes complex” of section Torva. Solanum iodotrichum must be a handsome species in the field with several large, deeply colored corollas open at one time per inflorescence."
wfo-0001026489,"Solanum barbulatum is similar morphologically to both S. psychotrioides (Colombia) and S. amblophyllum (Peru) but differs from those species in its small flowers and short fruiting pedicels. The trichomes in the vein axils of S. barbulatum are thinner and weaker than those of S. psychotrioides and usually dry white. The bark of S. barbulatum is usually bright white in dry specimens and appears to peel off in thin sections from the stem. Populations of S. barbulatum are more pubescent in Peru and progressively become more glabrous into Colombia, but much variation exists and populational samples are not known."
wfo-0001429693,"Solanum hydroides shares a set of morphological features with species of a small and still unnamed group, recently proposed on the basis of morphological (Gouvêa et al. 2018) and molecular evidence (Giacomin et al., unpubl. data). This group, endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comprises five previously described species: S. hexandrum, S. kollastrum Gouvêa & Giacomin, S. robustum H.Wendl., S. stagnale Moric. and S. sublentum. They are all medium- to large-sized shrubs with large repand leaves with decurrent bases (except S. kollastrum, which has cordate leaf bases), relatively robust and showy flowers with well-developed calyces that are accrescent in fruit and glabrous fruits (except S. robustum, which has weakly accrescent fruiting calyces and densely pubescent fruits)."
wfo-0001025655,"Solanum absconditum is similar to Solanum paludosum both of which have unbranched and few-flowered inflorescences, oblong-urceolate calyces, stellate corollas that are lilac to violet, and fruits held upright. The similarities to S. paludosum are superficial, however, and S. absconditum can be easily distinguished from it. In S. paludosum the leaf blades are elliptic to oval-elliptic and acute at the apex and strongly bicolororous, dark-green and glabrescent above with sparse porrect-stellate sessile trichomes, and yellowish to ferruginous bellow with a compact indument formed by porrect-stellate long stalked trichomes; and the corolla tube is smaller than 3 mm and the lobes are greater than 2 cm long.
The cordate to cordate-lanceolate, weakly bicolorous leaf blades, velutinous, cinereous or yellowish to ferruginous above with stellate-glandular and multiangulate stalked trichomes, the corolla up to 4 cm in diameter, and the 5-6 mm long, oblong-urceolate calyx tube, enlarged and constricted at the base in fruit, constitute a set of morphological characters that are very distinctive for S. absconditum."
wfo-0001028161,"Solanum gnaphalocarpon is superficially similar to S. pseudocapsicum (S. pseudocapsicum species group) in its dendritic leaf pubescence and general leaf shape, but differs from that species in many characters. Solanum pseudocapsicum has flattened-reniform seeds, larger flowers and fruit, and never has orbicular minor leaves. The trichomes on the fruit of S. gnaphalocarpon are distinctive and found nowhere else in section Geminata. They are tree-like, but with the axis much elongated and the general aspect of the trichome approaching a stellate type morphology. In fruit, S. gnaphalocarpon is not easily mistaken for any other species of section Geminata, or for that matter, in the genus Solanum. "
wfo-0001027816,"Unlike many of the members of the Dulcamaroid clade, S. endoadenium is a shrubby species and is apparently never a vine or even scandent. The leaves are consistently simple, and apparently never lobed or pinnatifid. Solanum endoadenium is easily recognised by its purple flowers, orange fruits and dense, often glandular-viscid pubescence of simple trichomes. The older stems are warty from the persistent leaf bases; this distinctive character distinguishes S. endoadenium from the somewhat similar S. salicifolium from the same region. Solanum endoadenium is further easily distinguished from S. salicifolium by its larger, usually branched inflorescences and more spreading pubescence (rather than appressed-ascending). Leaf size in S. endoadenium is quite variable, and varies within as well as between individuals. In general leaves near the stem tips are smaller than those lower down. Bitter (1913) stated that the epithet was derived from the glandular pubescence on the inside of the filaments."
wfo-0001026614,"The name Solanum fastigiatum has been used (e.g., by Morton, 1976) for a closely related species, now to be known as S. guaraniticum St.-Hil. However, all early cultivated material in European herbaria of this complex is S. bonariense, and the type of S. fastigiatum also proves to be a synonym of S. bonariense. Solanum bonariense is very similar to S. guaraniticum but differs by the smaller and sessile stellate hairs, giving it an almost glabrous appearance. Solanum guaraniticum occupies a more inland distribution in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.
"
wfo-0001026367,"Solanum asteropilodes is endemic to a small area of dry calcareous terrain in southern Ecuador near the town of Oña. It most closely resembles S. glutinosum. It can be distinguished from that species by its lack of abundant prickles, glandular hairs, or reddish pubescence, and its smaller and more entire leaves."
wfo-0001032276,"Solanum valerianum is related to S. capillipes of Trinidad and Venezuela. Solanum valerianum differs from S. capillipes in its denser, longer stem pubescence, smaller inflorescences, and in its leaf venation. The main lateral veins of S. valerianum do not prominently converge on one other (ie: not markedly brochidodromous sensu Hickey, 1974) as do those of S. capillipes. Collections from the Carara region in western Costa Rica have shorter trichomes than the type."
wfo-0001030335,"Solanum pertenue is related to S. confine of eastern Peru, with which it shares short, golden uniseriate trichomes, white flowers, and occasionally foetid foliage. It differs from that species in its tiny inflorescences and more elongate fruiting pedicels. The inflorescence in S. pertenue is reduced and in the type specimen bears only a single flower. Most plants of S. pertenue have 2 or 3 buds in each inflorescence, but in Monteverde, Costa Rica, the third of these usually does not open. If one of the first two buds is damaged or removed, the third bud opens and produces a flower. In Monteverde, Costa Rica, where I studied the reproductive ecology of this and six other species of section Geminata (Knapp, 1986a), S. pertenue is a shrub of the edges of treefall gaps, and grows under closed or nearly closed canopy forest. The flowers are pollinated largely by workers of Bombus ephippiatus, but small halictid bees also visit the flowers (see Table IX of Knapp, 2002). The leaves of S. pertenue are fed upon by the larvae of the ithomiine butterfly Pteronymia artenna (see Table XI of Knapp, 2002)."
wfo-0001031829,"The placement of Solanum tovarii in the S. amblophyllum species group is provisional, as the fruits and seeds of this species are not known. Solanum tovarii is morphologically similar to the much more widespread S. barbulatum and differs from it in its quadrate calyx lobes, larger flowers, and in its evenly distributed abaxial leaf pubescence. In S. tovarii the trichomes are over the entire abaxial surface, while those of S. barbulatum are confined to the main vein axils. Solanum tovarii is also superfically similar to two anomalous specimens (Boeke 892 from Napo, Ecuador and Nuñéz & Arque 8325 from Cuzco, Peru) which may represent a new taxon. These specimens differ from S. tovarii in their unifoliate sympodial units and elongate, branched inflorescences."
wfo-0001030772,"Solanum ramonense is very similar vegetatively to S. roblense, also of montane Costa Rica, but is easily distinguished from that species by its minute flowers, triangular calyx lobes, and large fruits on rather stocky pedicels. Solanum ramonense is most closely related to S. arboreum of lowland Central and northern South America, with glabrous leaves, congested pedicel scars, and berries borne on erect pedicels. The ripe fruit when split open smells strongly of wintergreen, a trait observed for other deep forest solanums (Knapp & Helgason, 1997). This suggests an animal dispersal agent, but none have been observed. Fruits of Solanum ramonense have been found on the forest floor with the seeds germinating inside (pers. obs.). The fruits have very few seeds, and the seeds are quite large. Solanum ramonense blooms in the late wet season and early dry season (Knapp, 1986a), an unusual flowering time for shrubs in the Costa Rica cloud forest. Most other species of section Geminata at Monteverde bloom at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season."
wfo-0001032358,"Solanum vespertilio is a striking species, with its large, purple, zygomorphic flowers and bright orange prickles. It can be easily distinguished from the only other prickly solanum with zygomorphic flowers occurring in the Canary Islands by its larger, paler flowers (see Figure 1 in Anderson et al., 2006), its ovate leaves with cordate bases, its red, rather than orange, berry and its prickly stems and petioles. The two species also differ in habitat, with S. vespertilio occurring in relictual laurel forests and S. lidii occurring on dry, rocky slopes. It appears that the flowers of S. vespertilio are uniformly 4-merous, no specimens I have seen have had 5-merous flowers. Anderson et al. (2006) and Dupont and Oleson (2006) report that a significant proportion of flowers are enantiostylous, with the style deflected either to the right or to the left. Whalen (1984) suggested that S. lidii and S. vespertilio were closely related to a morphologically very similar zygomorphic flowered New World Solanum, S. houstonii (as S. tridynamum). Recent molecular studies have shown that these two Canary Island species are more closely related to solanums of the African mainland (Anderson et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2006), although sampling from amongst this diverse group was not broad enough to pin down their sister relationships."
wfo-0001030198,"Solanum paniculatum is most similar to S. acutilobum of Bolivia and western Brazil, but in that species the leaves are persistently tomentose adaxially, and the fruits are only 0.6-0.9 cm in diameter and the seeds 17-22 × 1.4-1.8 mm. This species was introduced in about the 1950's into the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul (L. Mentz, pers. comm.). Given its wide adaptability to various disturbed habitats and weedy nature, Solanum paniculatum would probably become naturalized in other parts of the world if introduced. This species has acquired a number of synonyms based mainly on the great variability of leaf shape. This species is especially prone to producing deeply lobed leaves on vigorous young leaves and sprouts and much smaller and entire leaves on upper branches of older flowering plants. The plant is common throughout much of eastern Brazil, is attractive because of the bi-colored leaves and grows at the much-visited coastal cities of Rio de Janeiro and Salvador in the state of Bahia. All these characteristics combine to make Solanum paniculatum one of the most collected species in sect. Torva. Despite the great variability of leaf shape, the spreading or even recurved lower leaf lobes are distinctive in sect. Torva. "
wfo-0001027943,"Solanum ferrugineum can be recognized by its recurved fruiting pedicels and ferruginous stellate pubescence that is abundantly glandular on the inflorescence axes and calyces. The inflorescence is generally short and unbranched to forked. Spines are nearly lacking on fertile parts of the plants. The known distribution of S. ferrugineum includes dry tropical forest on the west coast of Mexico north of Chiapas and similar habitats in northwestern Costa Rica. It may be expected to occur in intervening dry forest habitats in other Central American countries. Nee (1993) cites two collections of S. ferrugineum from Veracruz, Mexico, which he believes to be casual introductions from the west. Morphological variation is complex among a number of species of sect. Torva in Costa Rica (e.g., S. torvum, S. rudepannum, S. ferrugineum, S. truncatum, and S. chrysotrichum), possibly due to interspecific gene flow. In Costa Rica, typical plants of S. ferrugineum with abundant glandular pubescence on the inflorescence axes and recurved fruiting pedicels occur at elevations from 0 to ca. 350 m near the west coast from Cabo Santa Elena and Parque Nacional Santa Rosa to the Nicoya Peninsula and the vicinity of Palo Verde and Puntarenas. A number of other collections resemble S. ferrugineum in some characters, but the inflorescence is not conspicuously glandular and the fruiting pedicels are erect. Although some of these plants are sympatric with typical examples of S. ferrugineum, mostly they occur somewhat further inland (near Liberia, Bagaces, and on the slopes of the Cordillera de Guanacaste). Perhaps these represent introgressants between S. ferrugineum and S. rudepannum or other species of Solanum section Torva in Costa Rica. Although the typical specimens agree in morphology with Mexican collections of S. ferrugineum, M. Nee (pers. comm.) thinks that these populations represent hybrids between S. rudepannum and S. torvum.

wfo-0001032289,"Perhaps to Martius this was a “variable” species, but aside from the multiplicity of leaf shapes which is often found in sect. Torva, Solanum variabile is easily recognized and distinctive in the area where it occurs. The only other species of sect. Torva which share its range are S. guaraniticum to the south and southwest which is a smaller plant with more numerous and acicular spines on the stems, and S. scuticum mainly to the north which has inflorescences shorter and lateral at all stages and smaller flowers. Solanum paniculatum is common in part of the range of S. variabile; S. paniculatum has strongly bicolorous leaves due to the soon glabrate upper leaf surface. Superficially S. variabile is more similar to several species of non-spiny Solanum in the region such as S. rufescens of sect. Brevantherum s.l. (Nee, 1999) or even S. mauritianum of sect. Asterochlaena (sect. Brevantherum s.s.), Nee, 1999, but it can be immediately distinguished from either of those species by the presence of prickles and the attenuate anthers with small terminal pores. The name Solanum repandum Vell. will probably have to be lectotypified on tab. 123 since the Vellozo herbarium is apparently no longer extant."
wfo-0001029171,"Solanum luteoalbum is similar to S. stuckertii and S. hibernum, all of which have elliptic leaves, stellate corollas, orange globose fruits, and large angled seeds. Solanum luteoalbum can be distinguished from S. stuckertii by its purple rather than white corollas and more northerly distribution. Hairs of S. stuckertii are exclusively unbranched, whereas those of S. luteoalbum can be either unbranched or dendritically branched. Solanum luteoalbum and S. hibernum are very similar morphologically. Both species have purple corollas and are often covered with dendritically branched trichomes; in S. hibernum the leaf surfaces are strongly discolorous due to the dense whitish covering of dendritically branched hairs on the lower surface, whereas the pubescence of S. luteoalbum is more or less evenly distributed. Solanum luteoalbum is also similar to pubescent forms of S. confusum, but can be distinguished from the latter by its stellate and usually deep purple corollas, shorter and often branched trichomes, and its more northerly geographical range. Peruvian specimens of S. luteoalbum from the Departments of Apurimac and Cuzco have an obvious, often dense indumentum of forked or dendritically branched trichomes on the axes and leaf undersides, especially on young parts. Macbride (1962) differentiated these collections as S. luteoalbum var. tunya. Plants from further north in Depts. Huánuco and Junín usually have a few branched hairs on the axes and leaf midribs, but these are not nearly as noticable as in the collections from southern Peru. Collections from Ecuador and Depts. Cajamarca and Piura in Peru, as well as the types of S. pubescens and S. semicoalitum have exclusively unbranched hairs and numerous stalked glands. Whether these variants merit taxonomic recognition is debatable. Herbarium specimens from these areas do not have any obvious morphological differences except for indumentum characters."
wfo-0001025804,"Solanum alatirameum is an unusual species in the group due to its sessile leaves and apparently terminal inflorescence, but it is probably best placed here until further studies can be done. The calyx with its minute apiculate lobes is similar to that of S. leucocarpon, as is the swollen pedicel apex in fruit. Smith & Downs (1966) placed S. alatirameum in section Anthoresis based on the terminal inflorescence. Other specimens, however, have lateral and leaf opposed inflorescences, so this is another case of the variability in inflorescence position in species of section Geminata obscuring their affinities."
wfo-0001032161,"In describing Solanum tunariense, Kuntze indicated that he thought it was related to S. pseudocapsicum, presumably due to its possession of dendritic trichomes. The trichomes are like those of S. pseudocapsicum, but even sterile specimens are easy to differentiate, due to the smaller, more ovoid leaves of S. tunariense and the dark shiny bark of mature stems. Solanum tunariense is most closely related to S. smithii of the Huancabamba depression in northern Peru and adjacent Ecuador, differing from it mainly in the more copious pubescence of the abaxial leaf surfaces."
wfo-0001027366,"Solanum cyclophyllum is closely related to S. triplinervium of Gorgona Island off the coast of Nariño department. It shares with that species three-nerved venation (at the base) and completely glabrous foliage. The regular, deltate to long-triangular calyx lobes and ovate to rounded leaves readily distinguish it from S. triplinervium. The parallel secondary venation shared between the two species is much more prominent in S. triplinervium (see Fig. 125 in Knapp, 2002). The only other member of the S. unifoliatum species group occurring at middle to high elevations is S. longevirgatum, which is easily distinguished from S. cyclophyllum by its golden pubescent stems and young leaves and its erose leaf margins."
wfo-0001029652,"Solanum morii is closely related to S. capillipes of Trinidad and the adjacent Paria Peninsula in Venezuela. It differs from that species in its consistently difoliate, geminate sympodial units and its smaller leaves with long-acuminate apices. It appears to be a plant of disturbed areas and secondary vegetation."
wfo-0001030846,"As delimited here, Solanum rhytidoandrum can be recognised by its shrubby habit, heavily armed stems, corymbose inflorescences with more than 10 flowers, white corolla 2.5-3 cm in diameter and hirsute ovary. Solanum rhytidoandrum shares the overall aspect of the plant and leaves with S. decorum, at least in some specimens. They can be differentiated by the redder pubescence of S. decorum that is composed of porrect stellate trichomes with reduced midpoints, as opposed to the rusty pubescence of S. rhytidoandrum composed of stellate trichomes with multicellular midpoints. Leaf shape and pubescence vary considerably in Solanum rhytidoandrum. Material from Bolivia is quite homogenous in being tomentose with persistent or deciduous (Steinbach 783) trichomes, reduced midpoints that are rarely multicellular (Daly et al. 2259). The leaves are larger, ovate, ovate-elliptic or even rhomboid (Nee 33898), with lobed-angulate (Nee 38582, 35898), sinuate (Hassler 8363) or entire (d’Orbigny 1068) margins. Leaf shape and margin can vary within an individual plant (Nee 35898, 37680). The flowers and calyx lobes are larger in Bolivian collections than in the rest of the range. The fruit has a leathery pericarp, with sparse sessile or stalked trichomes (Nee 38582, Daly et al. 2259). Material from northeastern Brazil generally has elliptic to ovate-elliptic leaves and smaller flowers (ca. 2.5 cm in diameter). The pubescence is tomentose, with porrect stellate trichomes with a midpoint that is unicellular or multicellular. In some specimens from the brejos of Pernambuco (ABC 665, 970) porrect stellate trichomes with a glandular midpoint occur on the pedicel. Some collections from Ceará (Drouet 2643, 2276) have more elliptic leaves and the fruit pubescence consists of sparse stellate and glandular trichomes; specimens intermediate with these types have been collected in Goiás. Looking at the two extremes of character combination might lead one to consider these forms distinct, but the continuous variation between these extremes is evidence that they should be treated as one, highly variable, taxon.."
wfo-0001027204,"Solanum confusum is characterized by its unbranched and often sparse hairs, elliptic leaves, long peduncles and pedicels, and usually campanulate-stellate corollas. It is most similar to S. glaucophyllum and to S. hibernum, S. luteoalbum, and S. stuckertii in the S. luteoalbum species group. Solanum glaucophyllum differs from S. confusum in its purplish-black fruits, narrower glaucous leaves, and rotate-stellate corollas. Solanum confusum differs from other species of the S. luteoalbum group in its more campanulate corollas and in its often sparse and shaggy pubescence. Collections from southern Bolivia (Dept. Tarija) and Argentina are morphologically homogeneous, with sparse pubescence and usually branched inflorescences. Collections from elsewhere in Bolivia can vary widely in degree of pubescence, inflorescence branching, and corolla size and shape. However, glabrous and densely pubescent individuals are found growing side by side in several Bolivian localities and apparently represent morphological variants of the same species. "
wfo-0001026777,"Solanum campaniforme is a widespread and variable species, and the following relatively well-marked geographical races exist. 1) Plants from the northern part of the range in the Guianas and around the mouth of the Amazon are glabrous with somewhat larger flowers than those from SE Brazil. The type of Solanum campaniforme comes from among these populations. 2) Collections from Ceará are generally more pubescent than many, and may approach Solanum intermedium, but do not bear the distinctive golden trichomes of that species. 3) Plants from Espirito Santo and Bahia retain the trichomes of the inflorescence characteristic of more southerly specimens of Solanum campaniforme, but otherwise approach the type in general morphology. These populations grow in coastal restinga or forest. 4) In the forests of Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, and São Paulo, plants have medium size flowers, elongate inflorescences, and berries about 1 cm in diam. Plants from these populations have been called Solanum caeruleum.  5) In the drier forests of Minas Gerais, populations consist of plants with larger flowers which often appear blue when dry and longer, more pubescent inflorescences. These have been called Solanum laxiflorum.  6) The southernmost populations from Santa Catarina and Paraná have smaller leaves and shorter inflorescences than plants from more northerly populations. Intermediates exist however, and the differences are minute. These plants have been called Solanum dusenii and S. microrbitum.  These geographical races are not easily delimitable, and the entire range of intermediates is found. Naming these would be counterproductive and serve to confuse an already complex situation that merits further field study. Solanum campaniforme has been collected from a variety of habitats including coastal forest and capoeira. It appears to be an opportunistic species and grows in open areas wherever they are found. Some of the morphological variation observed in S. campaniforme may be the result of ecotypic differences."
wfo-0001028587,"Solanum incomptum is most closely related to S. deflexiflorum of montane western Colombia, and differs from that species in its smaller flowers, longer inflorescences, deltoid calyx lobes, umbonate fruit, and in its more pubescent new growth. The umbonate fruit and the chartaceous calyx lobes in fruit are distinctive characteristics of S. incomptum.  Solanum incomptum is variable both as to degree of pubescence and length of trichomes. Those with the longest trichomes have been called S. incomptum var. longiuspilosum, and those with the shortest S. copeyanum, but the variation is continuous and even varietal distinctions are not warranted. The variation may be the result of the distribution of this species in isolated local populations throughout its range. "
wfo-0001031359,"Solanum spirale is the only Paleotropical and the only tetraploid member of section Geminata. No specimens of S. spirale have been collected in the New World, and its widespread use in India, Thailand, and Laos point to its being either native there or an old introduction. Henderson (1978) speculates on the status of S. spirale in Queensland and concludes that if it is an introduction, it has not spread as a weedy species should. Symon (pers. comm.) however, feels that the range of S. spirale is expanding in Australia, perhaps indicative of its being an introduction. Another instance of a close relative of an otherwise Neotropical group occurring in the Eastern Hemisphere tropics (in this case in the Society Islands) is Solanum repandum G. Forst. of section Lasiocarpa (Whalen et al., 1981; Bruneau et al., 1995). Solanum repandum however, is found only in association with humans, and may be a recent introduction (see discussion in Whalen et al. 1981). Solanum spirale is most similar, and perhaps most closely related to S. nudum, a widespread Neotropical species (see above). It differs from that species in its larger leaves, inflorescences, buds, and flowers, and in its bright orangish-red berries. Material from Australia is tetraploid with n=24, but no authentic chromosome counts exist for S. spirale from other parts of its range. The count of n=12 (Gerasimenko & Reznikova, 1968) for plants from Bogor certainly refers to S. diphyllum, a widely cultivated species often confused with S. spirale. More living collections of S. spirale are needed to determine its relationships to New World taxa. Crossing studies would be very useful in solving this problem. Despite its brightly colored berries, S. spirale is not closely related to S. pseudocapsicum or the members of that species group. Solanum spirale differs from those species in its deflexed fruiting pedicels, flower shape, and leaf trichome morphology."
wfo-0001029317,"Solanum malacothrix is most closely related and superficially quite similar to S. diphyllum, a widespread lowland Mexican species. Solanum malacothrix is distinctive in its long, soft leaf pubescence, which is unusual in the section; while S. diphyllum is completely glabrous. Solanum lasiocladum of Venezuela also possesses this type of leaf pubescence. It differs from S. malacothrix in its apiculate calyx lobes, larger flowers, and long-petioled leaves with acute apices, and I have not assigned it to any of the species groups. The mature fruits of S. malacothrix are not known, but in view of its overall similarity to S. diphyllum I would expect them to be brightly colored, borne on erect pedicels, and rather fleshy."
wfo-0001027395,"Solanum dasyneuron is most closely related to S. narcoticosmum of middle to high elevation Chiapas and Guatemala, and differs from that species in its larger flowers, and its dense pubescence along the veins on the leaf undersides. Solanum dasyneuron is perhaps derived from isolated populations of the more widespread S. narcoticosmum. It is of extremely limited distribution and has not been collected recently."
wfo-0001028688,"Solanum intermedium is related to S. reitzii and S. campaniforme, both species of southeastern Brazil. It differs from S. campaniforme in its indument of soft, golden trichomes, and from S. reitzii in its anthers of equal size. "
wfo-0001029440,"Solanum megaspermum presents a set of distinctive characters and has similarities with Solanum mesopliarthrum including the same type of 3- to many-branched, many-flowered inflorescence and flowers with white corollas. The similarities between S. megaspermum and S. mesopliarthrum, however, are superficial, and the two species are never sympatric. In S. mesopliarthrum the cymes are lax with fewer flowers; the calyx is deeply parted with a small tube and longer linear-lanceolate lobes; the indument is yellowish to canescent and lanuginose, with glandular-stellate stalked trichomes, with the central ray prolonged, many celled, and nearly 1 mm long, and the ovary is hirsute. The epithet megaspermum refers to the size of the seeds, some of the largest found in Solanum sect. Erythrotrichum."
wfo-0001029980,"Solanum nudum is an extremely common shrub and small tree of secondary habitats throughout low elevation Central and South America, but in some parts of its range (see below) it grows in higher elevation forests. It often forms dense, monospecific stands in open areas and river banks. Solanum nudum is one of the most commonly collected species of section Geminata.
Solanum nudum is remarkably uniform morphologically, considering its broad range. In Venezuela, high elevation specimens of S. nudum have larger flowers and more coriaceous leaves than material from Central America and the Caribbean, but plants with all intermediates in both of these characters have been collected ascending the mountains. This large flowered, high elevation race has been called S. tovarense. Specimens from the Amazon basin, and particularly those from the area around Iquitos, Perú, tend to have much larger leaves than plants collected in Central America and the Caribbean. These Iquitos populations also have trichomes uniformly distributed on the inflorescence axis and on the buds."
wfo-0001027368,"Solanum cylindricum differs from other species of section Cyphomandropsis from southeastern Brazil in its relatively narrow, simple leaf blades and frequent occurrence of branched hairs. Solanum pelagicum also has stems covered with dense dendritic pubescence, but it usually has pinnately compound leaves and is restricted to coastal restinga vegetation of southeastern Brazil. Solanum luridifuscescens has generally larger, wider simple leaves, lacks branched hairs, and has a dense band of scaly papillae on the abaxial surface of the anthers. Solanum matadori is glabrous, and has subcoriaceous leaf blades and branched inflorescences with very long peduncles. My concept of S. cylindricum encompasses a great deal of variation in pubescence, leaf size and shape, and inflorescence and fruit morphology. Specimens range from being nearly glabrous to densely pubescent with dendritic to substellate hairs. Leaf blades range from long and narrow to elliptic-ovate, and inflorescences vary from raceme-like with an extended rachis to contracted and umbel-like with pedicels clustered close together at the distal end of the axis. Fruits are obtuse to acute at the apices. Six morphotypes can be discerned in the material of S. cylindricum available to me, but all intergrade in morphological features and geographical distribution, arguing against recognition as separate taxa. Most specimens from Rio Grande do Sul have very narrow coriaceous leaves (length:width ratio ca. 3-10:1) with the blades nearly glabrous above and moderate to dense dendritic pubescence on the axes and abaxial leaf surfaces. The inflorescence is raceme-like, and lacks swellings at the bases of the pedicels. Many collections from Paraná, and Santa Catarina also have very narrow leaf blades with sparse adaxial pubescence, but differ in inflorescence structure: the flower pedicels emerge at nearly the the same point on the axis (umbel-like) and are subtended by a swelling or sleeve. Some specimens from Paraná and Santa Catarina have rather broad leaf blades with a length:width ratio of ca. 2-3.5:1, with a relatively sparse pubescence raceme-like inflorescences without pedicel swellings. The fourth morphotype also has rather broad leaves, but is notable in its extremely dense dendritic pubescence that nearly obscures the stems and abaxial leaf surfaces. This morphotype has raceme-like inflorescences without an obvious pedicel swelling or sleeve. Specimens with sparse to moderate branched pubescence, mostly from western parts of Paraná and Santa Catarina, were described as S. subhastatum Smith & Downs and constitute a fifth morphotype. The sixth morphotype consists of nearly glabrous plants, usually with narrow leaves, ellipsoidal to ovoid and sometimes pointed fruits and short, few-flowered inflorescences, that have been segregated as S. iraniense Smith & Downs. Though each of these elements is somewhat distinctive when viewed in isolation, I cannot discern consistent morphological or geographical disjunctions that separate them, and therefore I have subsumed all these variants under one taxon.
"
wfo-0001030453,"Solanum platycypellon is closely related to S. maturecalvans, also of Andean distribution. It differs from that species in its unifoliate sympodial units, smaller flowers and flatter, more open calyx tube. Solanum maturecalvans is a plant of higher elevations, while S. platycypellon occurs in subtropical moist forest at somewhat lower elevations. The arachnoid pubescence typical of members of the Solanum nigricans species group is very soon deciduous in S. platycypellon, but is always present on the new growth and the tips of the inflorescence axes. Solanum platycypellon may be a synonym of S. kieslingii, but the latter has distinct triangular calyx lobes, while the calyx of these speciemsn is quite distinct. Further field study is necessary to resolve this issue."
wfo-0001028528,"Solanum imbaburense is superficially similar to S. stenophyllum and S. ruizii, but differs from them in its lax dendritic pubescence, particularly on the inflorescence, its glabrous, coriaceous leave with strongly revolute margins and in its extremely long-acuminate calyx lobes. Some populations of S. stenophyllum have some glabrous individuals, but these always possess at least some tree-like trichomes on the new growth. Berry colour in S. imbaburense is to date not known, but is probably black."
wfo-1000075694,"Like Solanum dolosum S.Knapp but with planar leaf margins and tufts of dendritic trichomes in the vein axils of abaxial leaf surfaces (vs. ruffled leaf margins and simple trichomes distributed along the midrib abaxially in S. dolosum), difoliate sympodial units (vs. unifoliate sympodia in S. dolosum), terete stems (vs. strongly winged stems in S. dolosum)."
wfo-1000075692,"Like Solanum imberbe Bitter but with the minor leaves orbicular (vs. linear to lanceolate in S. imberbe) and the new growth densely rusty papillose (vs. glabrous in S. imberbe). Like Solanum anisophyllum Van Heurck & Müll.-Arg. but with shorter nodes, strongly winged stems (vs. terete stems in S. anisophyllum), lanceolate leaves with acute apices (vs. elliptic with acuminate apices in S. anisophyllum), leaves sessile or with petioles less than 2 mm long (vs. leaves with clearly differentiated petioles 10-20 mm long in S. anisophyllum)."
wfo-0001025893,"Solanum amnicola is morphologically extremely similar to S. monadelphum, also a shrub of river banks in eastern Peru. Solanum amnicola can be distinguished from S. monadelphum by its slender leaf-opposed inflorescences, long-acuminate calyx lobes, smaller flowers, and the minute golden trichomes along the veins on the underside of the leaves. Solanum monadelphum is much more common than S. amnicola where the two occur in sympatry. Solanum amnicola is known from only a few localities, but is probably found throughout eastern Peru and only rarely collected."
wfo-1000031018,"Despite being currently known to us from a single collection, we describe S. kachinense here because it is so distinct, and that future botanists will be encouraged to find more collections because the entity is known to exist. Very often botanists pass by spiny solanums as uninteresting, in part due to the ubiquity of many introduced species such as S. torvum. Solanum kachinense is named in honour of the province of Myanmar where it occurs, and for the Kachin peoples of the region – who generously assisted the Kingdon-Wards while they were collecting in the region."
wfo-0001030698,"Solanum putii is very similar and may be conspecific with S. robinsonii, but we hesitate to synonymise these two taxa until more material is available; the similarities were noted in the original description (notes in packet on holotype at K; Barnett 1963). The leaves of S. putii are more broadly elliptic, more softly pubescent, and less discolorous that those of S. robinsonii; they are also markedly oblique at the base, while those of S. robinsonii are not. The lamina beneath is clearly visible and the rays on the stellate trichomes are thinner and more delicate. A single dissected flower on the isotype sheet at BM is 7-merous and clearly fascinated, perhaps indicating this is an aberrant plant, a note by Kerr on the holotype at K states “Only flower of Put 3227 examined was abnormal with double ovary, stamens, etc.”. The fruit of S. putii are smaller (ca. 0.6 cm in diameter) than those of S. robinsonii (ca. 1 cm in diameter)."
wfo-0001028997,"Solanum laurifrons is an isolated species in section Geminata, with no apparent close relatives. It is superficially similar vegetatively to S. goniocaulon in its glabrous leaves that dry golden yellow beneath, but is unrelated to that species and differs from it in possessing flattened reniform seeds and sympodial units that are not geminate. Solanum laurifrons is anomalous in this species group in being completely glabrous, but shares with the other species of the group fleshy buds and flowers, flattened reniform seeds and a tendency to possess elaborate inflorescences and plurifoliate sympodia."
wfo-0001027630,"Solanum dolosum is most closely related to S. gonyrhachis from high elevation eastern Bolivia. It differs from that species by the characters detailed in the key. Plants of S. dolosum have been said to be hemiepiphytic, but I suspect that this small shrub occasionally merely grows in moss on trunks or fallen logs in its cloud forest habitat."
wfo-0001022516,"Lycianthes shunningensis is recognised here with some hesitation, and the material included here may in fact belong to two different taxa. The specimens seen and grouped here all have strongly reflexed calyx appendages arising from usually more than 1 mm below the calyx rim. This morphology is also seen in L. connata J.L.Gentry of Mexico and Guatemala. The appendages in L. shunningensis vary in length, those on the type specimen from Yunnan in China and Averyanov et al. AL887 from Laos are long and conspicuous, while those on the type of var. remotidens and other collections are small nubs and quite inconspicuous; all, however, are strongly reflexed and arise well below the calyx rim. Variation in calyx appendage length is common in other Asian Lycianthes species (e.g. L. laevis, see description and discussion). On all of the specimens I have seen the leaf pubescence of L. shunningensis is also distinctive in being confined or nearly confined to the adaxial surface, most of the other taxa treated here when pubescent have denser pubescence on the abaxial leaf surfaces."
wfo-0001022373,"Lycianthes laevis is a widespread species with considerable regional variation. It can be recognised by its calyx with 5 appendages, these are usually quite short, but in southern India and Indonesia can be filiform and up to several mm long. The calyx appendages always appear longer in bud. A collection from Mount Makiling in the Philippines (Sulit 8499) has a single flower with 7 appendages, but this is the only example of L. laevis I have seen with more than 5 calyx appendages. Lycianthes laevis can be distinguished from other species in the area with 5 calyx appendages (e.g., L. banahaensis, L. bimensis) by its shrubby versus tree habit and in its cosexual flowers with membranous (versus thick and somewhat fleshy) corolla lobes. Like those of L. schizocalyx, the pedicels in fruit can be elongate, in both species reaching to 3 cm long. The berries of L. laevis are marginally smaller (0.8–1.3 cm in diameter versus 1–1.3 cm in diameter) but the number of calyx appendages (10 in L. schizocalyx versus 5 in L. laevis) is distinct."
wfo-0001026725,"Solanum caavurana is related to S. symmetricum of eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and northwestern Argentina. Solanum caavurana differs from that species in its large, petaloid calyx lobes, more elongate inflorescences, ellliptic to ovoid buds, and larger flowers. The petaloid calyx of S. caavurana is distinctive; the only other species with such large calyx lobes is S. warmingii, which is also related to S. caavurana. Solanum caavurana has tufts of trichomes in the axils of the main lateral veins of the leaf undersides, and the leaves usually dry blue-black, while S. warmingii is less pubescent (but still possesses a few axillary trichomes) and dries a pale green or yellowish color. Collections of S. caavurana from northern Bahia and Ceará do not dry as blue-black as those from other parts of the species range, and those plants also have more acute, less rounded, leaf apices than plants from more southern populations. The northern populations are somewhat isolated from the main portion of the species range and are perhaps in the process of divergence. These plants have been called S. acuminatum var. viridiflorum and S. anacamptorhachis.  Solanum caavurana is quite common in the forests of southeastern Brazil, and grows in a variety of habitats. It occasionally forms dense, foetid, monospecific thickets (K. S. Brown, pers. comm.). Vellozo (1829) stated that this species was ubiquitous, especially in second growth. He also reports several uses for S. caavurana. It was used as a soap to whiten linen, and as the source of a blue dye. "
wfo-0001030834,"Solanum retrorsum is polymorphic for prickliness; some plants are densely prickly with the downward point prickles that give the species its name, while others lack prickles entirely. These unarmed plants have been called S. luzoniense. Despite this polymorphism S. retrorsum is distinctive, with its narrowly elliptic leaves and very small ripe berries, and not easily confused with any other species in the region."
wfo-0001028876,"Solanum kleinii is closely related to Solanum pseudocapsicum, and differs from that species in its more copious, longer dendritic pubescence and larger flowers. Fruits of S. kleinii are not known, but I expect them to be orange-red at maturity, with flattened-reniform seeds. The pubescence of Hatschbach 7384 from Paraná is smaller and less dense than that of specimens from Santa Catarina, but this is probably because collections of S. kleinii from Santa Catarina are from a single population. Both collections from Santa Catarina have woody tap roots attached. This habit is common in the S. pseudocapsicum group and may be associated with periodically dry habitats."
wfo-0001030486,"Solanum plowmanii is related to S. gratum of the Venezuelan Cordillera de la Costa. The two species share fleshy leaves that dry a rich golden brown and fleshy flowers that apparently open synchronously (see Fig. 102A, 110 in Knapp, 2002). The leaf apices of both are generally rounded, an unusual condition in section Geminata. The flowers of S. gratum are reported to be sweetly fragrant but no such information exists for S. plowmanii.  The isolated forests of the western slopes of the Andes in which Solanum plowmanii occurs are a very limited habitat under threat of deforestation at present (Sagástegui A. & Dillon, 1991; Dillon, 1993)."
wfo-0001028105,"Solanum gertii is closely related to S. pseudoquina, also of southeastern Brazil. It differs from that species in its equal anthers and long trichomes on the stems and new growth. It is found within the range of S. pseudoquina and may be a geographical isolate of that species."
wfo-0001031040,"Solanum saponaceum is very similar to S. caricaefolium and is the more robust higher elevation counterpart of that lowland species, and slightly larger in almost all respects; both dry with a decided dark caste. The white corollas of S. caricaefolium also differ from the normally blue or violet ones of S. saponaceum. The plants may propagate by root sprouts (Nee 53591), but this has not been investigated for this or most other species of shrubby Solanum.  The effective seed dispersers are unknown, but ripe fruits have been seen pecked open by birds and the pulp and seeds partially removed (Nee 53591)."
wfo-0001027200,"Solanum confine is most closely related to S. pertenue of montane Central America, and to S. yanamonense of lower elevation eastern Peru. It differs from those species in its taller stature, larger flowers, and shorter fruiting pedicels. The foliage of S. confine is foetid when the plants are growing in sunny areas. The corolla lobes are not strongly reflexed at anthesis. This species is one of the few in this species group to grow in rank secondary growth as well as in primary forest. Solanum confine is a variable species, with more pubescent individuals occurring at higher elevations. Solomon 9052 was said to be growing as an epiphyte in moist forest. "
wfo-0001032489,"Solanum wallacei is quantatively as well as qualitatively distinct from S. umbelliferum, its closest relative, although DNA sequence data do not unambiguously support a specific level difference (George 2011). Flowers and fruits are larger, and the green spots on the corolla are smaller and often completely lacking in S. wallacei. Island forms of S. umbelliferum from the more northerly Channel Islands (sometimes recognised as S. clokeyi) approach S. wallacei in pubescence morphology, with long simple uniseriate trichomes, but the flowers and fruit of those island populations fall within the range of the rest of the distribution of S. umbelliferum."
wfo-0001027997,"Solanum foetens is a distinctive plant and not easily confused with any other Solanum. Characters which immediately distinguish S. foetens from its close relatives, S. narcoticosmum and S. dasyneuron, are its sessile leaves with densely pubescent undersides, strikingly winged stems, unifoliate nodes, and its deeply lobed planar corollas. In the páramo at the summit of the old Boconó-Trujillo road, S. foetens grows with another species of section Geminata, S. validinervium (S. amblophyllum species group), with which it is somewhat similar morphologically. The two species differ in microhabitat, with S. foetens growing in wetter, more protected microsites. Flower odor also differs between the species: S. foetens has completely odorless flowers in all sites, and the S. validinervium has flowers with a spicy odor. In the aforementioned site, the two species bloom at the same time, but no intermediates were found."
wfo-0001027882,"Solanum evonymoides is a distinctive species, with its shiny, glabrous leaves and its open, highly branched inflorescences with large, white flowers. Label data indicate that the flowers are sweetly scented (Kalllunki et al. 706A). The cucullate, strongly hooked petal lobe apices are distinctive in S. evonymoides. Confusion over the identity of Solanum evonymoides has existed for some time, with specimens being annotated as a variety of taxa. Specimens of S. evonymoides have been annotated as S. glomuliflorum Sendtn,, a species of uncertain identity (most probably a species of Aureliana Sendtn. or Athenaea Sendtn., see Knapp, 2002). The later S. evonymoides J. Rémy in Gay (1846), a species of coastal southern Chile, is a synonym of S. valdiviense Dunal (Knapp, in prep.), a member of section Holophylla s.s. (see Knapp, 1989). Solanum cordioides has been annotated as S. evonymoides in several herbaria (see Knapp, 2002), but the two species differ in flower morphology (corolla 0.6-0.8 cm in diameter and green in S. cordioides, 2.1-2.6 cm in diameter and white with cucullate, hooked apices in S. evonymoides) and fruit size (1-1.2 cm in diameter in S. cordioides, 2-3 cm in diameter in S. evonymoides). Solanum evonymoides has also been confused with S. sycocarpum Mart. & Sendtn. (ex Cyphomandra), with which it is very similar morphologically; S. evonymoides differs in its uniformly reddish bark, the pedicels abscising flush with the inflorescence rachis and thus not leaving conspicuous pegs, and in its anthers without an enlarged connective (typical of members of the Cyphomandra group, sensu Bohs, 1994, 2005, in press). Populations of S. evonymoides from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states with smaller, shinier leaves, and altogether smaller in all parts (flowers included) are here treated as a geographical variant, but may warrant distinction at the species level (Custodio Filho 265; Hoehne 3042; Martinelli et al. 13274, 13360; Martins et al. 12361; Pirani et al. 3028A). Some of these plants with very coriaceous leaves and smaller flowers are from higher elevations (1000-1800 m) and are components of saxicolous vegetation (Martinelli et al. 13274). These plants, despite their marked habitat differences from other populations of S. evonymoides share the key characteristics of the species: glabrous foliage, difoliate but not geminate sympodia, branched inflorescences with white flowers, petals with cucullate, hooked apices and green fruits at maturity."
wfo-0001032190,"The stems and inflorescence axes of S. umbellatum have a shaggy appearance due to the abundant long-stalked stellate hairs. The leaves are scabrous and strongly discolorous, green above and light yellowish below. The stipitate-glandular trichomes visible at 6x magnification are diagnostic for this species, and easily distinguish it from any other species like it in Central America. The sessile trichomes on the upper leaf surfaces distinguish it from other similar South American taxa (S. conglobatum, S. fulgens), both of which have multiseriate stalks on the trichomes of the upper leaf surfaces. "
wfo-0001028329,"This species is very similar to the widespread weedy S. erianthum, but differs in having glabrous to sparsely pubescent ovaries and fruits and the base of the calyx swollen into an annular ring. The character of swollen bud bases, diagnostic in Mexican and Central American specimens, is not as evident in some specimens from northern South America. The stems and inflorescences have a tufted appearance due to the echinoid hairs (hairs with many short rays emanating from one point to form a solid ball resembling a hedgehog or sea urchin) and the leaf surfaces are strongly discolorous, while those of S. erianthum are more or less concolorous. "
wfo-0001030941,"In the original description of Solanum rugosum, Dunal cites three specimens, of which Blanchet s.n. was selected as the lectotype. Of the two specimens from Brazil, i.e., Martius 623 and Blanchet s.n., the former is Solanum asperum L. C. Rich. (fide BM) while the latter is S. rugosum as traditionally known. The third syntype, Krauss s.n., from Guadeloupe, is also traditional S. rugosum but is a poor specimen (at least the one in Herb. DC., fide microfiche). Consequently the Blanchet specimen at P was considered the best choice of lectotype by Roe (1967). Among other species in section Brevantherum, Solanum rugosum most closely resembles S. asperum and S. bicolor in having mixed sessile and short-stalked, porrect-stellate and sometimes multangulate trichomes on its peduncles, pedicels, and calyces. It is often confused with these species (and others in the Brevantherum group) but differs from both in having mostly sessile and occasionally short-stalked, porrect-stellate trichomes on its abaxial leaf surfaces, rather than mostly short-stalked, porrect-stellate and multangulate trichomes. Additionally and more specifically, S. rugosum can be distinguished from S. asperum by its longer, wider obovate to elliptic (rather than lanceolate) leaves, and its smaller calyces (3-4.5 mm relative to 4-6 mm long in S. asperum). From S. bicolor, S. rugosum differs in having moderately pubescent (rather than densely pubescent to tomentose) abaxial leaf surfaces, somewhat longer (2-3.2 mm relative to 1.7-2.5 mm) anthers, and somewhat larger (0.8-1.1 cm in diameter relative to 0.6-0.8 cm) fruits. Solanum rugosum also tends to have rather stipitate-glandular and sparingly pubescent to glabrescent calyx tubes that are often darker in color than the more persistently pubescent calyx lobes, another feature that can help to distinguish it from S. asperum and S. bicolor."
wfo-0001029408,"Solanum mauritianum is distinguished by its terete and lanate or velutinous stems; stem hairs partly to mostly long-stalked; axillary leaves often strongly developed; leaf apices long-attenuate; and hairs on lower leaf surfaces usually long-stalked in part. This species and S. granuloso-leprosum appear to intergrade in southeastern Brazil, judging from herbarium specimens. Some specimens of possible hybrid origin show high pollen stainability while others appear nearly sterile. "
wfo-0001027449,"Solanum deflexiflorum is closely related to S. incomptum of montane Costa Rica and Panama. It differs from that species in its larger flowers, long-acuminate calyx lobes, sparser leaf pubescence, and glabrous young growth. The two species share erect fruiting pedicels and woody accrescent calyces. Solanum deflexiflorum is quite variable in inflorescence pubescence, and the two extremes have been named as two different species. This seems excessive, as intermediates in pubescence density exist, and the two pubescence types and their intermediates occur together throughout the Cordillera Occidental. Such variation in pubescence is common in section Geminata."
wfo-0001026962,"Solanum chalmersii was mentioned as a probable new species in Knapp (2002), but at that time material was not sufficient to distinguish it from other similar species in the large Solanum nudum species group and good fruiting material was not available in order to place it confidently in that group. Solanum chalmersii possesses the flattened reniform, pale colored seeds, simple uniseriate trichomes and more or less closely spaced pedicel scars typical of the S. nudum species group. It is most similar to S. acuminatum Ruiz & Pav. of central Peru to Bolivia, with which it is nearly sympatric, but differs in its uniform covering of simple uniseriate trichomes (usually confined to the vein axils in S. acuminatum), its flowers with longer anthers with slightly sagittate bases, and in its longer fruiting pedicels. In Bolivia, S. acuminatum occurs at higher elevations than S. chalmersii. "
wfo-0001029363,"Solanum mapiricum is very similar to both S. daphnophyllum and S. symmetricum, also of Bolivia. It differs from S. daphnophyllum in its pubescent vein axils and buds, and closely packed pedicel scars; and from S. symmetricum in its minute free portion of the filaments, small flowers, pubescent buds, and elongate flowering axis. This may also be an extreme range extension of the otherwise more Atlantic S. campaniforme. The affinities of this rare species are not clear at present; more collections and detailed field notes concerning habit and habitat are needed."
wfo-0001030010,"Solanum obovalifolium is most closely related to S. sessile of the Amazon basin (Knapp, 1991b), particularly to higher elevation populations of that species. Solanum obovalifolium generally lacks the erect uniseriate trichomes so characteristic of other members of the S. sessile species group, but agrees with them in several other characteristics, such as fleshy flowers, large leaves, and branched inflorescences. The constriction just below the calyx lobes is less pronounced in S. obovalifolium than in other members of the group. Most of the collections of Solanum obovalifolium are from the state of Aragua, but this in part reflects the intensity of collecting in this area. Solanum obovalifolium is a light gap colonizer and probably occurs at low densities throughout the coastal ranges of Venezuela, and into the Andes of Trujillo and Mérida. In Parque Nacional Henri Pittier, Aragua, S. obovalifolium grows in dense stands in old light gaps under closed canopy cloud forest."
wfo-0001027902,"The affinities of S. fallax are problematical. This species was originally described as a member of the genus Cyphomandra (now Solanum section Pachyphylla) and was treated as such by Bohs (1994). However, the anther connective is not greatly enlarged in this species, and its flower and fruit structure, especially its distally swollen calyx and thick angled seeds as well as its tolerance of drier sites, is more suggestive of species of section Cyphomandropsis. It is anomalous in the latter section due to its very large cordate leaves, its pedicels articulated above the base leaving prominent pedicellar remnants, and its pubescent fruits. Molecular data suggest that S. fallax is more closely related to species of section Pachyphylla than Cyphomandropsis."
wfo-0001031482,"Solanum stipulaceum is distinguished from all other species in section Brevantherum by its lanceolate or narrowly elliptic leaves, corollas weakly exserted from the calyces at anthesis, and relatively thin calyces that often split into irregular lobes. This species is related to the geographically close S. granuloso-leprosum and may have been derived from it; individual specimens can be difficult to identify. Solanum stipulaceum is very common in the dry forests, campos rupestres and caatingas of NE Brazil. "
wfo-0001030676,"Solanum pulverulentifolium seems to be closely related to S. chiapasense with which it is sympatric. It is distinguished by the whitish, pulverulent (rather than dark green) leaves, minute calyx lobes, and corollas strongly exserted from the calyx at anthesis."
wfo-0001026453,"Solanum bahamense as defined here is widely distributed around the Caribbean basin. Morphologically it is extremely variable in terms of leaf shape and size (populations from the Bahamas and Cuba tend to have small, prickly leaves with occasionally shallowly lobed margins, while populations from the Lesser Antilles are usually without prickles, with large, lanceolate leaves), flower colour (white in the eastern part of the species range, lavender in the western part of the range) and stem prickliness. In the Lesser Antilles, Howard (1989) suggests that plants with fewer prickles are inland and more prickly plants are near to the sea, but this generality does not hold across the species range. Some herbarium specimens lead us to believe that juvenile plants are prickly and lose their prickles as they get older, but field studies are necessary to show this is in fact the case. Solanum bahamense is most similar to and probably most closely related to the narrow Puerto Rican endemic S. ensifolium. Detailed molecular and morphometric analyses show the two to be distinct, but difficult to distinguish in the absence of good label data. Solanum bahamense differs from S. ensifolium in its red rather than black berries, shorter (sessile with short mifpoints) stellate trichomes on stems and inflorescences and in its low elevation seaside habitat. In general, S. bahamense grows on calcareous soils near the coast throughout the Caribbean basin, while S. ensifolium is a plant of higher more inland elevations on Puerto Rico. Solanum bahamense, despite its wide distribution in the Caribbean basin, is completely absent from the island of Hispaniola, where its other close relative, S. polyacanthon, is endemic. This may be the result of geological differences, although S. polyacanthon also occurs in seaside habitats on calcareous soils, or to competitive exclusion due to vicariance events during the formation of the Greater Antilles. The broad distribution of S. bahamense across the archipelago may be relatively recent and due to dispersal by birds. Further population level analysis will be needed to elucidate reasons for the complex distribution pattern observed in both occurrence and morphology within S. bahamense."
wfo-0001030489,"Solanum plumense is a rare Mexican species that can be distinguished from other members of section Brevantherum by its very sparse echinoid pubescence, slender petioles, and thin leaves that appear at first glance to be glabrous on both surfaces. Nelson’s locality “Pluma” is actually Pluma Hidalgo, a town ca. 25 miles (ca. 50 km) NE of San Miguel Suchistepec (Morton & Schultes,1942); the coordinates are 15°55'0'' N, 96°25'0'' W."
wfo-0001027237,"Solanum cordioides is a very distinctive species, with its shiny elliptic leaves and small greenish-white flowers. It is most similar and probably related to S. acuminatum of central Peru, with which it shares branched, usually internodal inflorescences, and short, stout anthers. It differs from S. acuminatum in being completely glabrous. The species is named for its marked likeness to some species of Cordia (Boraginaceae), for which it has been misidentified in the past. It appears to be endemic to the Una Reserve, which is home to many other species endemic to the Atlantic coastal forests of Bahia and Espiritu Santo (Thomas et al., 1998)."
wfo-0001032307,"Solanum venosum is closely related to S. oblongifolium with which it is completely sympatric. The species are superficially very similar, with large leaves and complex inflorescences, but differ in trichome color and morphology. The stem trichomes of S. venosum were described as ""pilus crassiculis, pubescentibus"" by Humboldt, Bonpland and Kunth (1818). This has caused considerable confusion (see Morton, 1944), but the stem trichomes of S. venosum indeed appear pubescent. They are of the Christmas-tree-like echinoid type with the branches off the main axis of the trichome closely packed and occasionally secondarily branching. This secondary branching is unusual in trichomes in section Geminata. Leaf and stem trichomes of S. venosum are red-brown while those of S. oblongifolium are always transparent or dry white."
wfo-0001031615,"Solanum symmetricum is probably most closely related to S. caavurana, also of southern South America. Solanum symmetricum differs from that species in its pedicel scars clustered in the distal 1/3 to 1/4 of the inflorescence axis, smaller, non-petaloid calyx lobes, more deeply lobed flowers, minute filament tube, and elongate anthers. The subumbellate form of the inflorescences is distinctive, and makes S. symmetricum easy to distinguish from other members of the S. nudum species group. There are relatively few older collections of Solanum symmetricum from Bolivia, probably due to the collecting deficit in that country which is rapidly being redressed. Many collections exist from Argentina where the plant is apparently quite common. The populations in Misiones and Paraguay are discontinuous with the rest of the species, but definitely represent the same species. They are possibly relictual in nature. "
wfo-0001026379,"Solanum atitlanum seems to be closely related to S. axillifolium judging by their similar hairs, calyx texture and appearance at anthesis, and the presence (at least in young plants) of axillary leaves. It is distinguished by the frequent absence of axillary leaves on mature plants, comparatively small, usually violet corollas, and whitish or greyish tomentum on young stems."
wfo-0001029810,"Solanum nigricans is superficially similar to and probably the sister species of S. maturecalvans of the Andes, sharing with that species patchy arachnoid pubescence and difoliate, geminate sympodial units. Like the rest of the species in this group, S. nigricans occurs at middle to high elevations, where it is apparently a common element of the oak-pine forests of southern Mexico. The apically pointed fruit and matted pubescence make S. nigricans easily distinguishable from any other solanum growing in similar habitats. Variation in pubescence is quite marked in Solanum nigricans with some specimens having loose, dendritic trichomes that dry reddish (reminiscent of S. callianthum of Colombia), rather than the more typical matted, arachnoid pubescence. The type specimen of S. brachystachys comes from this end of the range of variation, but intermediates exist across the species range. Further field study may reveal that these more loosely pubescent populations do represent a distinct species."
wfo-0001029673,"Solanum muenscheri is a species of very limited distribution, found only in the mountains of N Guatemala and adjacent S. Mexico. It is apparently common locally and grows in mixed woodland and grassland near the tree line. Flowering specimens have been collected throughout the year, but there appears to be a peak in flowering in December. Solanum muenscheri differs from S. nitidum, its closest relative, in its black berries, yellowish indument and in its generally somewhat smaller inflorescences. The species share soft dendritic trichomes and parallel veined leaves (see Knapp, 1989)."
wfo-0001026538,"Solanum bicolor resembles S. asperum, also of N South America, in its short-stalked trichomes, but differs from it in having broadly elliptic (rather than lanceolate) leaves, whitish (rather than ferrugineous) pubescence on the stems, and a glabrous (rather than tomentose) ovary. Solanum bicolor is a more coastal species, distributed in northern South America on both coasts and in the Caribbean. Solanum asperum is widely distributed through the lowlands of South America."
wfo-0001028920,"Solanum laevigatum is superficially similar to S. cornifolium (S. nigricans species group), also of the Colombian Andes. It differs from it in its barbate vein axils of the abaxial leaf surface and in its generally lower elevation distribution. The trichomes are a somewhat darker brown and not quite so dense. Both species have polymorphic glabrous and pubescent ovaries, as does another sympatric species, S. callianthum.  I have seen no recent collections of Solanum laevigatum from Ecuador, although the type collection of S. obovatum is apparently from southern Ecuador near Cuenca (prov. Azuay). Barbour 3595, from Amazonas Peru, is more densely and loosely pubescent than Colombian material. As more material from Ecuador and Peru becomes available, these plants (i.e. from Ecuador and Peru) may be shown to be distinct from S. laevigatum s.s."
wfo-0001026992,"Solanum chiapasense apparently is closely related to S. pulverulentifolium but can readily be distinguished by its dark green instead of whitish upper leaf surfaces, larger calyx lobes, and weaker corolla exsertion from the calyx at anthesis. Some specimens at NY had flowers with styles substantially shorter than the stamens (S. Croutch, pers. obs.). It is not known if these are staminate flowers. Most, if not all members of sect. Brevantherum have been thought to produce exclusively perfect flowers."
wfo-0001029152,"Solanum lucens is probably related to S. falconense from the Sierra San Luis in the state of Falcón, Venezuela. Characters shared between the two species are discussed with the latter. Solanum lucens is easily distinguished from S. falconense by its glabrous leaves and pale green berries borne on erect pedicels. The fragrance of the flowers of S. lucens (citronella fide Tillett et al. 761-25) is unusual in the section. The flowers of S. lucens seem to open synchronously, with an entire branch or plant being in bud, flower, or fruit at the same time, a character shared with S. gratum and S. plowmanii. "
wfo-0001027384,"Solanum daphnophyllum is an anomalous species in the S. nudum species group. It is probably most closely related to S. restingae of coastal Bahia, Brazil. Solanum daphnophyllum is unusual in section Geminata in growing in dry, deciduous semi-tropical forest. It is common where it occurs (Nee, pers. comm.). Peruvian material from around Macchu Picchu with more elongate infloresences with more widely spaced pedicel scars cited by Knapp (2002) as S. daphnophyllum is now recognized as S. sumacaspi S. Knapp (Knapp, 2005). The inflorescence in Solanum daphnophyllum is not strictly leaf-opposed as is the case in most species of section Geminata. The inflorescences appear to be short shoots that are borne terminally (as all inflorescences in Solanum), but are later overtopped by the continued growth of axillary shoots, thus they are lateral in flower and fruit, but not always (see S. sessile group for a similar situation)."
wfo-0001030882,"Solanum roblense is very similar in appearance and is probably closely related to S. ramonense, another montane Costa Rican species. Solanum roblense is easily distinguished from S. ramonense by its larger flowers, longer, thinner anthers with a terminal thickened portion, and by its narrower leaves. The calyx of S. roblense is truncate in bud, in flower the lobes become short deltoid, and in fruit are woody and accrescent, while the calyx lobes of S. ramonense are long-triangular in bud and flower, and shrivel and break off in fruit."
wfo-0001029938,"Solanum nitidum is a common component of high elevation areas in Peru and Bolivia, and it is also commonly grown in household gardens for its medicinal properties. It is most closely related to S. muenscheri of Guatemala and S Mexico, differing from that species in its red berries and its Andean distribution. Pubescence is quite variable in S. nitidum, but many intermediates exist and there appears to be no geographical component to the variation. Broad repand leaves are found in young plants of S. nitidum, and leaf shape is quite variable across the species range. Polymorphism for flower colour exists in S. nitidum, with some populations consisting of only plants with white flowers, while others are of mixed white and purple flowered plants. White-flowered plants are much rarer than those with purple flowers. This colour polymorphism is common in the spiny solanums and does occur throughout the genus. "
wfo-0001026440,"Solanum axillifolium most closely resembles S. atitlanum, both species having dendritic-echinoid hairs, axillary leaves and thin-textured calyces which enclose the corollas until anthesis. It is distinguished from that species by its more conspicuous axillary leaves on mature plants, large, white corollas, longer anthers and greenish-yellow tomentum on young stems."
wfo-0001030093,"Solanum oppositifolium is most closely related to S. confertiseriatum of western Ecuador and Peru (see Knapp, 1991b). It differs from that species however in its Amazonian distribution, smaller leaves and inflorescences, and in its probably andromonoecious (rather than dioecious) breeding system. These sister taxa may have speciated allopatrically (Knapp, 1991b). Solanum oppositifolium is a widespread and variable species, and the following are some its more well marked geographical races. 1) Plants from central and southern Peru and adjacent Brazil have simple inflorescences and pubescent berries. The leaf undersides of plants from these populations dry a pale, golden brown. Ruiz and Pavón's type specimen of Solanum oppositifolium came from among these populations. 2) In the inundated forests of the Amazon basin, plants often have long, branched inflorescences, glabrous berries, and usually leathery, larger leaves. This race has been called Solanum schizopodium (an adult plant) and S. viliflorum (a tiny plant with its first inflorescence). Vásquez (1997) misidentified Iquitos plants of this race as S. confertiseriatum, which only occurs on the western slopes of the Andes. 3) A higher elevation, isolated race on the slopes of the Guyana sandstone plateau has simple inflorescences, glabrous berries, and usually leathery leaves. This form is relatively limited in distribution and has been called Solanum puberuloba.  Many other forms more local in distribution could be described. It would be counterproductive to provide formal names for this mosaic of variation, as even these well marked geographic races are not easily delimitable entities. Specimens exist that bridge all the gaps and a complex pattern of variation exists in which several geographical norms appear."
wfo-0001029552,"Solanum microleprodes is closely related to S. xanthophaeum and S. malletii, both of the Amazonian slopes. It shares with those species a dense indument of branched trichomes and swollen calyx tube base in fruit. The trichomes of S. microleprodes are tree-like or echinoid, with short, congested branches, while those of the two South American species are loosely dendritic. D'Arcy's var. felicis from Chiriquí province has more loosely branched trichomes than material from Darien and Colombia, but specimens from Herrera and Veraguas are intermediate in this character."
wfo-0001028339,"Solanum heleonastes is closely related to S. robustifrons of eastern Peru and adjacent Brazil, differing from that species in its longer calyx lobes, smaller leaves, and generally more pubescent young stems and leaves. Solanum heleonastes is usually a small tree (but occasionally a shrub), and S. robustifrons is a small shrub or treelet growing in the understory of dense forest at middle elevations. Solanum heleonastes is one of the few species of Solanum section Geminata growing in swamp forest and is apparently quite common in areas where it is found."
wfo-0001027248,"Solanum cornifolium is morphologically quite similar to S. laevigatum (S. arboreum species group), also of Colombia, but differs from it in its non-barbate vein axils and denser, more greyish pubescence. The berry pubescence polymorphism is present at both local and regional scales, with specimens not clearly dividing into regional sets. "
wfo-0001031684,"Solanum tenuiflagellatum is most closely related to Solanum leptorhachis of western Ecuador, sharing with that species an extremely elongate inflorescence, flowers with the petals held planar at anthesis, and pedicels that in fruit are nearly four times their length at anthesis. Solanum tenuiflagellatum is easily distinguished from S. leptorhachis by its much longer inflorescences, copious leaf pubescence, acuminate calyx lobes which are recurved at anthesis, and greenish flowers. The inflorescences of S. tenuiflagellatum are the longest in the S. confine species group, and also in the section. They are thread-like and often become tangled in the leaves of the branches below them. Solanum tenuiflagellatum has only been collected a few times despite its striking inflorescence morphology. Where it does occur, often several plants are found in the area, but it seems to have a rather patchy distribution over its geographical range."
wfo-0001031225,"Solanum sieberi is most closely related to S. imberbe of Panama, coastal Colombia, and Venezuela, but differs from that species in its elliptic, geminate leaves, flowers with the petals strongly reflexed at anthesis, and its fruiting pedicels with a conspicuous rhomboidal swelling at the apex. Solanum sieberi is polymorphic for the prescence of uniseriate trichomes, which if present, are on all parts of the plant. This is reflected in the large number of names given to this species by Pittier (many of which are only on herbarium annotation labels); most of these ""taxa"" are merely pubescence variations. Populations of the species from adjacent areas differ in only this character, and I do not consider this a particularly informative character in this species. The flowers of S. sieberi have a sweet scent, and the plants flower profusely, attracting a number of small generalist bees (see Table IX in Knapp, 2002). The habitat of S. sieberi is most commonly near seeps and other wet places in otherwise rather dry habitats. In Parque Nacional Morrocoy, Venezuela, the plants grew at the edges of roads in ditches of standing water and at the edges of mangrove swamps, beyond the reach of salt water. "
wfo-0001030661,"Solanum pubigerum is extremely similar to S. aligerum, with which it broadly overlaps in central Mexico and Central America. The two species can be very difficult to distinguish, but S. pubigerum has simple trichomes all along the midrib, rather than dendritic trichomes concentrated in the veins axils or over the entire lamina. Flowers are smaller in S. pubigerum with the calyx lobes deltate rather than quadrate (this can be difficult to see), and the berries of S. pubigerum are also smaller and usually red when ripe (although label data conflict on this point, so some variation may exist). The leaves of S. pubigerum are in general broader than those of S. aligerum, but not consistently so, and although leaf size in both these species is quite variable, specimens of S. pubigerum have been collected with very small or very large leaves, probably due to habitat conditions. The stems of S. pubigerum are never winged from the decurrent leaf bases, but those of S. aligerum are often prominently winged, with the wings persisting in quite old stems. In general the two species appear to not occupy the same forest types where their ranges overlap. "
wfo-0001026357,"Solanum asperum is a lowland species of northern and eastern coastal South America, sporadically ranging into lowland areas of Central America. It can be distinguished by its persistent ferruginous pubescence of porrect-stellate and multangulate, short-stalked hairs with fewer than 12 lateral rays and its pubescent ovary and lower style. The leaves of herbarium specimens are generally rough to the touch on the upper surfaces. "
wfo-0001031401,"Solanum stenophyllum is one of the most easily recognised members of the Solanum nitidum species group, with its strongly discolorous leaves that are bright yellow beneath. It is most closely related to S. cutervanum and S. ruizii, differing from those species in its winged stems and glabrous styles. In N central Ecuador, near Quito, populations of S. stenophyllum often have white flowers and occasionally pubescent styles. The leaf pubescence of these plants also appears a brighter shade of yellow when dry than that of other populations. This geographical variant has been called S. neriifolium Bitter. These plants are otherwise identical to the rest of the species range, so these populations are not accorded species status. A few collections of S. stenophyllum are nearly glabrous and superficially similar to S. imbaburense. These plants, however, always have at least some echinoid trichomes and appear to be rare regional variants."
wfo-0001030445,"Solanum placitum is distinguished by its large leaves with acuminate apices; leaves below with ferruginous tomentum along the veins, thus making the venation noticeably prominent; long flowering pedicels; large flower buds; and long styles. There are several specimens of Solanum placitum that are somewhat problematical and are difficult to separate from the Bolivian species S. conglobatum. Further, S. fulgens (from central Peru) has been considered a synonym of S. placitum (Nee, 1999). The former is known only from the type collection, which limits understanding of the relationship between the two species. Further collecting and analysis of specimens from western Amazonia may lead to modifications of species boundaries within sect. Brevantherum."
wfo-0001031881,"Solanum triste is related to S. turgidum of higher elevations on the Paria peninsula (Sucre, Venezuela), from which it differs in its white flowers, pubescent leaves, longer fruiting pedicels, and second growth habitat (see Knapp, 1991b). Solanum triste is a rank second growth weed, and grows in large stands at the edges of pastures. The leaves are quite foetid smelling, and this characteristic is reflected in the common name of this plant in Venezuela. Near Cumanacoa, Venezuela, the leaves of S. triste are fed upon by the larvae of the ithomiine butterfly Pteronymia latilla (see Table XI in Knapp, 2002). These caterpillars were quite common where I collected them, and defoliated plants of S. triste. "
wfo-0001030624,"Solanum pseudoquina has long been known as S. inaequale Vell., but the epithet pseudoquina has priority (see above and Carauta, 1973 for dates of publication of Florae fluminensis). Solanum pseudoquina is closely related to a rare species of southeastern Brazil, S. reitzii, with which it shares dimorphic anthers with small, round pores. This character state is found only in these two species. Solanum pseudoquina is easily distinguished from S. reitzii by its larger flowers, glabrous stems, leaves with pubescence only in the axils of the main lateral veins beneath, and the pale yellow venation of dry material. Solanum pseudoquina is common in southeastern Brazil. It grows to be a large treelet and is often locally common where it occurs. In São Paulo, St. Hilaire reported the use of the bark of Solanum pseudoquina as a febrifuge, hence the specific epithet. A chemical extract of the bark revealed a high percentage of a bitter substance (""principe amer de nature purement végétale..1/12""), which was not further analyzed (St. Hilaire, 1825). Two other species of the S. nudum species group (S. nudum in Colombia and S. spirale in Laos) are also reported to be used as febrifuges. Chemical analyses may reveal characters to further support the unity of this difficult group. "
wfo-0001030914,"In the cladogram of the sessile species group, Solanum rovirosanum is part of a trichotomy in the oppositifolium subclade (Knapp, 1991b). Solanum rovirosanum itself has no automorphies suggesting it is close to the stem. Species such as this have been hypothesized as ancestral species in some groups (see Kitching et al., 1998), but are more commonly refered to as stem species (Forey, 1992) or have recently been termed plesiospecies (Olmstead, 1995). Fruit pubescence varies geographically in Solanum rovirosanum, with populations from Mexico and Guatemala having pubescent ovaries and berries, and populations from Costa Rica and Panama having glabrous ovaries and berries. The significance of this character is not yet understood. The same type of polymorphism occurs in S. sessile of the Amazon basin. Material with glabrous berries has been called S. brenesii. The two races are otherwise not different from one another. The more easterly populations (i.e. Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia) of S. rovirosanum may be specifically distinct, but further field study is necessary, particularly in the northern part of the species range. In Costa Rica, Solanum rovirosanum grows in both primary and secondary forest, and the two forms are quite different morphologically and are often identified as different species. The primary forest plants, growing under closed canopy, have large, obovate leaves, and often have simple inflorescences. Those plants from pasture edges have smaller, often elliptic, rather coriaceous leaves, and larger, usually branched inflorescences. These differences are striking at first glance, but upon closer examination, the two forms are obviously the same species. Forest and secondary growth plants are visited by different bees, and bloom at different times in the site where I studied them (Monteverde, see Knapp 1986a). Secondary growth plants are visited primarily by Melipona spp., and forest plants by bumble bees (see Table IX in Knapp, 2002). The peaks of flowering time differ for the two forms, but the populations studied were at the extremes of an elevation and aridity gradient, so this is perhaps not surprising. Plants between the two study populations are perhaps in bloom in the intervening interval, thus maintaining gene flow in this species; however the situation may merit closer investigation."
wfo-0001030004,"Solanum oblongifolium is a very common shrub at middle to high elevations and usually grows in open places along roadsides or pastures. It is most closely related to S. venosum, with which it is sympatric in at least part of its range. Solanum oblongifolium differs from S. venosum in its transparent trichomes which are always dendritic, never tree-like as are those of the stems of S. venosum. The flowers of S. oblongifolium are borne in very large inflorescences, however these are often not collected as they are difficult to press. The petals are quite waxy and the flowers have a sweet fragrance, unusual in the section (but see S. validinervium in the amblophyllum group and S. corumbense in the leucocarpon group). Leaf base morphology varies considerably throughout the range of Solanum oblongifolium and has no obvious geographical component. Leaves vary from petiolate with the petioles to 3 cm long to sessile with the leaf bases somewhat auriculate. In these latter plants, the leaf base has been termed ""crotaloid"", because when dry it resembles a rattlesnake's tail (see S. crotalobasis Bitter, a synonym of S. maturecalvans Bitter of the nigricans group, named for its similar leaf bases). Plants from northern Peru are generally larger than those from the rest of the species range. They have been called var. soukupii Macbride. Some hybridization may occur between Solanum hypaleurotrichum and S. oblongifolium in Ecuador. Specimens of this type are listed with S. hypaleurotrichum (see above) and are generally closer to S. hypaleurotrichum in overall morphology than to S. oblongifolium, but possess abaxial leaf surface trichomes that are intermediate between the two species. "
wfo-0001026230,"Solanum anisophyllum is related to S. arboreum, and differs from it in its long-acuminate calyx lobes and smaller flowers. The long-acuminate calyx lobes are superficially similar to those of S. tanysepalum from montane coastal Venezuela. The two species are not closely related within the group and can be easily distinguished by other characters. Solanum anisophyllum has elongate inflorescences with small flowers and closely spaced pedicel scars and orbiculate minor leaves, whereas S. tanysepalum has sessile inflorescences with larger, fleshy flowers and elliptic minor leaves. Solanum anisophyllum is a shrub of primary forest and is a sparse species (Rabinowitz, 1981) with few individuals in any given population. I have selected the specimen at G as the lectotype of S. anisophyllum as the Morton photograph (see above) of it is widely distributed and it was one of two (the other at AWH) cited in the original description."
wfo-0001030007,"Solanum oblongum is closely related to S. lindenii of Peru and Bolivia, but differs from that species in its pubescent ovaries, longer, thinner trichomes, and in its pubescent calyces and inflorescences. Solanum oblongum, although locally common where I have collected it, has not been collected very often. It is apparently of relatively restricted distribution in central Peru along small streams and rivers at middle elevations."
wfo-0001030048,"Solanum ochrophyllum is one of the most distinctive species of section Geminata with its bicolored leaves and closely and densely matted pubescence on the abaxial leaf surfaces. Plants are quite similar to those of S. maturecalvans, but the density of trichomes on the lower leaf surfaces and the non-geminate sympodia are clear differentiating features. "
wfo-0001027627,"Solanum dolichosepalum can be recognized easily by its velvety, ovate acuminate leaves; its generally small, short pedunculate inflorescences; the caudate calyx lobes; and the stelliform to pentagonal stelliform, lavender corollas. It appears to be related to S. ovalifolium, with which it shares much of its range. The latter species has less velvety vestiture, larger inflorescences, relatively slender pedicels, and less prominent calyx lobes. The calyx lobes of S. rudepannum sometimes are long and almost caudate like those of S. dolichosepalum, but the corollas of S. rudepannum are always white and the inflorescence is larger. "
wfo-0001030943,"Solanum ruizii is certainly one of the most spectacular members of the Solanum nitidum species group with its large, deep purple flowers. All of the specimens of this species characterize it as being very showy. Label data on Woytkowski 147 (F) state that S. ruizii is ‘very common up to 3600 m.a.s level. Sometimes, growing in open places, attains considerable height and forms trees’. Solanum ruizii has not been collected since the early part of the 20th century, but large-scale habitat destruction probably accounts for this. Collections of this species come from slightly drier areas than typical ‘ceja de la montaña’ vegetation in which other members of this group occur. These drier areas are characterized by extensive expanses of high elevation grassland or ‘pajonal’. Solanum ruizii can be distinguished from its closest relative S. cutervanum by flower size and by the number of seeds in the berries (ca. 30 versus only 7-8 in S. cutervanum). Mature fruits of S. ruizii are not known."
wfo-1000031017,"According to its morphology, S. bohsii is a member of the Solanum sessile species group (sensu Knapp 1991; 2002b) with difoliate and geminate sympodial units, large leaves and large branched inflorescences and ovoid-reniform seeds. It is easily distinguished from the other species in the group by its large leaves up to 45  cm long and the secondary veins strongly parallel in mature leaves. Solanum bohsii is morphologically similar to S. chlamydogynum from Venezuela with which it shares the winged stems, the fleshy large flowers with cucullate lobes and the presence of trichomes in both leaf surfaces. However, trichomes of S. bohsii are simple or, at most, furcate, translucent and less abundant compared to S. chlamydogynum which has dendritic ochraceous trichomes. Furthermore, inflorescence peduncles are less pubescent in S. bohsii, while densely pubescent with ochraceous trichomes in S. chlamydogynum. Solanum bohsii has distinctive mature fruits in dry material with a network-like pericarp, resembling the venation of leaves. From the other species in the Solanum sessile species group, it is easily recognised either by the pubescence, the winged stems, the large leaves or the large flowers with cucullate lobes (see Knapp 1991; 2002b)"
wfo-0001027834,"Solanum erianthum is an extremely common felty white shrub, occurring in disturbed areas worldwide and could be characterised as an invasive species. The leaves are strongly foetid smelling, and the fruits are held high above the leaves. They are most likely distributed by bats. The corollas are usually white with lobes having greenish midveins but are reportedly yellow or yellowish orange on some specimens from China. Solanum erianthum is native in Central America and the Caribbean but is widely introduced and naturalised in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. Solanum erianthum is very similar morphologically to S. hazenii (with which it occurs sympatrically in its native range) but differs from that species in its bud bases that are not markedly swollen and in its tomentose ovary (and berry). It differs from S. umbellatum, with which it is also sympatric, in its echinoid or dendritic-echinoid trichomes, S. umbellatum has porrect stellate trichomes that are often long-stalked and in general has a more floccose appearance, especially on the new growth. Solanum erianthum is one of two widely distributed and often invasive species of the Brevantherum group, the other is S. mauritianum, which differs from S. erianthum in its orbicular buds, and velutinous or lanate pubescence of long-stalked trichomes. Solanum mauritianum usually also has numerous small, axillary leaves and uniformly purple corollas or purple corollas with a broad white midvein stripe, but not always.
"
wfo-0001028502,"Solanum hypaleurotrichum can be difficult to distinguish from S. oblongifolium and S. venosum at a superficial glance. It differs from those species in its long-petiolate, usually somewhat smaller leaves, smaller fruits on elongate fruiting pedicels, and in its trichome morphology. The branches of the inflorescence in S. hypaleurotrichum are usually longer and there are fewer of them than in S. oblongifolium. The trichomes of S. hypaleurotrichum are distinctive and are somewhat intermediate between dendritic and arachnoid in structure. They are generally beige colored and their density varies considerably. In some specimens of S. hypaleurotrichum the trichomes of the abaxial leaf surfaces are densely matted and arachnoid (see above). This probably represents an extreme in intraspecific variation, but may be indicative of hybridization with S. oblongifolium."
wfo-0001027019,"Solanum chlamydogynum is a distinctive species, with its densely pubescent leaf undersides and large waxy flowers. It is quite common along roadsides near Caracas. The winged stems of S. chlamydogynum are striking and the wings are persistent on quite large stems (fide Nee 17319). Solanum chlamydogynum was described by Bitter as in section Anthoresis due to the presence of branched trichomes. It clearly belongs in the S. sessile species group, as its shares all the synapomorphies of the group (see Knapp, 1991b). Solanum chlamydogynum is most closely related to S. triste with which it shares branched trichomes, white edged calyx lobes and seeds with incrassate margins. Solanum chlamydogynum is always found at higher elevations and in wetter habitats than is S. triste. "
wfo-0001028228,"Solanum gratum is related to S. plowmanii of the western Andean slopes in Peru. It shares with that species thick, fleshy leaves that dry golden brown, fleshy flowers that apparently open synchronously, and fruiting pedicels deflexed from the weight of the berry. The bark of both species is pale and shiny. The leaves of S. gratum are distinctive and make this species easy to recognize on herbarium sheets. They are thick and relatively coriaceous, and dry a rich golden brown. The undersides dry with a golden tinge. The thick leaves that dry a golden brown are similar to those of S. goniocaulon, but the pale shiny bark and non-angled stems make S. gratum easy to distinguish from that species. The plate of S. gratum in the Flora del Avila (Steyermark & Huber, 1978) shows many flowers open synchronously. When in flower S. gratum must be a conspicuous plant. It is not common, even in Parque Nacional El Avila, where it has been collected most often. Most collections are of flowering plants."
wfo-0001026267,"Solanum aphyodendron is most similar and probably closely related to S. trichoneuron of southern Bolivia and Argentina, from which it differs in its larger flowers, shorter inflorescences, and somewhat larger berries. Solanum aphyodendron is a common species of roadsides throughout Central America and northern South America and it often forms large monospecific stands in open areas. Material from Central America, Colombia and Venezuela is quite uniform. Variability in pubescence increases in Peruvian and Bolivian specimens, with some specimens having shorter trichomes on the calyx lobes and denser tufts of trichomes in the vein axils. In Monteverde de Puntarenas, Costa Rica, Solanum aphyodendron blooms at irregular intervals throughout the year (Knapp, 1986a). Data from herbarium specimens and observations of this species in Panama and Ecuador indicate that its flowering behavior is very much the same throughout its range. At Monteverde, S. aphyodendron is pollinated by meliponine bees, primarily by Melipona fasciata (Knapp, 1986a). The occurrence of large monospecific stands of S. aphyodendron combined with the foraging behavior of Melipona produces high fruit set in this species. The fruits are eaten by small frugivorous bats and disappear soon after they become ripe. Solanum aphyodendron has long been confused with S. nudum, to which it is somewhat closely related, but differs in habitat, flower size and pubescence of flower parts, and in the color and texture of the bark of older stems. Solanum nudum occurs in low elevation thickets, sometimes on beach strands, and has dark brown bark and glabrous, globose buds. The bark color remains consistent even on herbarium sheets, with S. aphyodendron being pale white or greenish and S. nudum being dark brown or black."
wfo-0001029989,"Solanum nutans is a variable species, particularly with respect to pubescence. Specimens from Peru (including the type) are densely yellow pubescent, while those from Ecuador and Colombia tend to be less densely pubescent and the trichomes are more matted and brownish-red in color. The trichomes of S. nutans are distinctive and distinguish it from all other species in this group. Trichomes of the stems and leaves are dendritic, with very short, congested branches. They approach the echinoid trichomes of S. microleprodes, but are more elongate and highly branched. "
wfo-0001029089,"Solanum lindenii is closely related to S. oblongum but differs from that species in its resinous new growth and inflorescences, and in its indument (when present) of mostly branched trichomes. These two species both have fleshy flowers with the petals planar at anthesis, globose, fleshy buds, berries borne on erect fruiting pedicels, and tiny, flattened seeds. The variation in degree of pubescence in S. lindenii is extraordinary, but specimens of all intermediates between the two extremes are found. Solanum lindenii is the name that was applied to the glabrous members of the species, while S. psidiifolium was applied to the pubescent individuals. In Bolivia, both extremes of pubescence are found, but in Peru plants usually have a sparse indument of branched trichomes. The inheritance of trichome type and density in S. lindenii is of interest, as is the pattern of trichome ontogeny."
wfo-0001028975,"Solanum lasiocladum is quite similar to S. malacothrix, from Guerrero in western Mexico. It shares with that species the dense indument of uniseriate trichomes, but differs in its larger minor leaves, longer inflorescences, long-petiolate leaves, and larger flowers. The summit of the Serranía de Turimiriquire has only been ascended by botanists a few times, and twice S. lasiocladum has been collected, but no mention of its local abundance is made on either label. The Serranía de Turimiquire is isolated and is often covered with clouds."
wfo-0001027302,"Solanum crispum is one of the most variable and is the most southerly species of the Solanum nitidum species group, occurring to 43 degrees S latitude. It also has a huge elevational range, occurring from sea level to nearly 3000 m in a wide variety of habitats. Two pubescence forms occur throughout the range of S. crispum: glabrous plants have traditionally been called S. crispum and pubescent ones S. congestiflorum. Specimens of intermediate pubescence are rare, but the new growth of glabrous plants is always dendritic-pubescent. In a cladistic analysis (Knapp, 1989) the two forms were treated as separate, but were strongly resolved as sister taxa. Pubescence may have to do with habitat, but this effect ahs not been studied in any detail. The pubescent form often has larger, more repand leaves than does the glabrous form. This raises the intriguing possibility that the pubescent form is paedomorphic, retaining the shape and indument of juvenile leaves. Medicinal uses of Solanum crispum have been recorded for over two centuries, beginning with Ruiz & Pavón in Flora Peruviana in 1977, where the plant was reported to be used as a febrifuge. It has been reported as used against the fevers called ‘congo’ and ‘chavalongo’. Solanum crispum has been cultivated in the United Kingdom since the early part of the 19th century. Specimens were introduced to Kew Gardens from the island of Chiloé (Chile) by Mr. Anderson (Hooker, 1844) and a variety still in cultivation today was developed at the Glasnevin Botanic Gardens in Dublin. Solanum crispum is usually classed as a climber, but this is due to its lanky habit in the British climate. It does not possess twining stems, petioles or tendrils of a true climber."
wfo-0001026706,"Solanum bullatum is not clearly related to the other species of sect. Brevantherum. Its rather furfuraceous pubescence allies it with sect. Anthoresis while its accrescent calyces and glabrate upper leaf surfaces place it close to S. leucodendron and other species in sect. Lepidotum. Indeed, Dunal (1852) regarded his S. macropus (based on S. bullatum Vell.) as a member of sect. Lepidotum. S. bullatum provides evidence for the close relationship of sections Brevantherum, Anthoresis, and Lepidotum. It is characterized by young branches and peduncles sulcate; stem hairs partly dendritic, nearly furfuraceous; leaves coriaceous, glabrate above; calyx accrescent in fruit; rays of hairs often variously twisted."
wfo-0001028980,"Solanum lasiopodium is most closely related to S. nudum, a widespread species of northern South America and the Caribbean. It is very like the high elevation race of S. nudum (S. tovarense), but differs from that set of specimens in its much larger, fleshier flowers, pubescent new growth and calyx lobes, and its ovoid buds with the corolla soon exserted from the calyx lobes. Solanum lasiopodium may be an geographical isolate of its more widely distributed relative S. nudum."
wfo-0001028529,"Solanum imberbe is most similar to S. sieberi of coastal Colombia and Venezuela, particularly to the glabrous populations of that species. It differs from S. sieberi in its non-geminate, usually completely glabrous narrowly elliptic to lanceolate leaves, flowers with the corolla lobes only somewhat reflexed at anthesis, and its corky fruiting pedicels without conspicuous apical swellings. Solanum imberbe is also distinct in habitat from S. sieberi, growing in river courses. Like other solanums growing in these situations, S. imberbe has narrow leaves, and is subject to periodic inundation. Leaf shape is quite variable in S. imberbe. Plants from central Panama have obovate to oblanceolate leaves, but further east in Panama and in northern South America plants have narrowly lanceolate to even linear leaves. The narrowest leaves are found on plants from Zulia state, Venezuela, these being the eastern-most populations of the species. Flower and fruit morphology are constant throughout the species range."
wfo-0001032232,"Solanum unifoliatum is very similar to S. longevirgatum of high elevation Cordillera Occidental, but differs from that species in its lack of pubescence. It is probably most closely related to S. cyclophyllum and S. triplinervium, both of the Chocó floristic province. A habitat note on Gentry & Fallen 17585 indicates that the vegetation where S. unifoliatum occurs (""wet forest on grey sand"") is very like that of Amazonian white sand regions. Only two flowers are present on the type specimen, and one of these is apparently short-styled. Andromonoecy has not been demonstrated in section Geminata, but this is one of the many species with short and long-styled flowers. The large numbers of fruit set on each inflorescence of S. unifoliatum seems to indicate that the species is not andromonoecious (see Whalen & Costich, 1986), but further work is clearly needed."
wfo-0001032194,"Solanum umbelliferum and its close relative S. wallacei are among the most easily recognised species of the Dulcamaroid clade in being woody shrubs or subshrubs that do not climb with twining petioles with rotate purple (rarely white) corollas with prominent almost ruffled interpetalar tissue. Only S. flaccidum and S. laxum of southern Brazil (S. laxum also in widespread cultivation) have corollas with very short lobes that are almost rotate, but both those species have white flowers and are vines that climb with their petioles. Solanum viscosissimum, also of southern Brazil, shares densely glandular pubescence with S. umbelliferum (at least some populations; see below), but it is a vine with white flowers. The flowers of S. umbelliferum have two green spots that are edged with white at the base of each petal lobe underneath the anthers. This character is shared with S. dulcamara, S. lyratum, S. septemlobum and S. pittosporifolium, with which S. umbelliferum is closely related according to DNA sequence data (L. Bohs, unpublished). Those four species are all herbaceous or slightly woody vines, climbing by twining petioles, and have stellate corollas (except S. septemlobum with a more pentagonal corolla and consistently lobed leaves). The green spots have variously been interpreted as “pseudonectaries” and pollinator attractants (Buchmann et al. 1977, also see above under S. dulcamara)."
wfo-0001030733,"Solanum quebradense is superficially very similar and probably closely related to S. callianthum of high elevation Colombia. The uniseriate pubescence shared by these two taxa differs from the more common matted pubescence found in other members of the S. nigricans species group. Solanum quebradense can be distinguished from S. callianthum by its simple rather than dendritic pubescence, narrower leaves, glabrous ovaries and smaller, less fleshy flowers. Fruits of Knapp & Mallet 6778 were very pale green in color."
wfo-0001027258,"Solanum corumbense is closely related to S. leucocarpon, a widespread species of Central and South America. Characters in common are the swollen calyx in flower and fruit and apiculate calyx lobes. When I originally described S. tumescens it was from largely glabrous Bolivian specimens. Since that time many specimens of intermediate pubescence have been collected (e.g. Nee & Solomon 36658) and it is clear the two taxa are synonymous. Pubescence in S. corumbense is extremely variable across the species range, as it is in S. leucocarpon (see above), and may to some extent be related to the dryness of the habitat. As with many of the species in this group, S. corumbense is superficially similar to species of Solanum section Pachyphylla (Cyphomandra, also see Bohs, 1994). The close affinities of this group may lie with either section Pachyphylla or with section Cyphomandropsis, but this idea remains to be tested."
wfo-0001030182,"Historical evidence suggests that Solanum paludosum is a species with origins in northeastern Brazil. The oldest collections are from 1830-1832 (Blanchet 641; Salzmann s.n., 382) from Bahia. Later collections form further north in Brazil and the Guianas are scarcer, the oldest (Schomburgk 1260) is from 1843. The species as delimited here is relatively homogenous, and can be recognised by its rusty indument of porrect stellate trichomes and repand or subrepand leaves that are strongly discolorous; dark green and glabrescent on the upper surface and yellow to rusty and tomentose on the lower surface. The infloresences are few-flowered and the flowers are deeply parted, purple and to 4 cm in diameter. Juvenile plants are densely pubescent with sessile stellate trichomes with an elongate multicellular midpoint to 5 mm, while in adult plants the stellate trichomes have reduced, 1-celled midpoints. Plants from the north and south coastal regions of Brazil are uniform in having ovate, angulate leaf blades that are repand or subrepand. In the north of Brazil in inland areas plants are more variable, with great leaf variability even in a single collection (e.g., Ule 7693); leaves can be ovate to elliptic and repand to entire. In Venezuela and the Guianas, leaves are ovate and entire or elliptic and narrower, with rusty-red or yellow indument and a smaller calyx with shorter lobes than in Brazilian material. "
wfo-0001031832,"Solanum trachycyphum is distinguished from all other species in section Brevantherum by the ferrugineous hairs on young stems and peduncles that are sessile or short-stalked porrect-stellate, and by the bullate upper leaf surfaces. It may be separated from the similar and closely related S. selachophyllum by its shorter stem hairs and smaller seeds."
wfo-0001030871,"Solanum riparium is distinguished from all other species in section Brevantherum by its decurrent leaf bases that are sometimes abruptly and narrowly so; prominent lateral veins on lower leaf surfaces; corollas exserted early, often ribbed in bud; and calyces short, the lobes small. The name S. riparium has long been applied incorrectly to the species described as S. appressum in Roe (1972). How this misapplication of the name came about is not known, nor is it understandable, since type specimens are extant. The illustration in Ruiz & Pavón (1799) is not definitive for S. riparium but the species cannot be confused with S. appressum, which has lanceolate to narrowly elliptic rather than broadly elliptic leaves."
wfo-0001031152,"Solanum selachophyllum may be recognized by its long, thick-stalked, reddish brown stem hairs, bullate adaxial leaf surfaces, and large fruits. It can be distinguished from the related and very similar S. trachycyphum by its longer stem hairs and larger seeds."
wfo-0001026279,"Solanum appressum is recognized by its usually lanceolate leaves that are greyish-green above and especially below, the cuneate to short and narrowly attenuate leaf bases, the tertiary veins prominent on lower surfaces of leaves, the stem hairs minute and sessile, with some hairs on the pedicels long, thin-stalked, and its early exserted corollas. Specimens of this species were previously often identified as Solanum riparium Pers., though the type of that name is distinct from S. appressum. Solanum appressum can be distinguished from S. riparium by its more lanceolate leaves, its long-stalked hairs on the calyx lobes, and its uniformly sessile stem hairs."
wfo-0001025657,"Solanum abutiloides is distinguished by its glandular hairs and stipitate glands on many plant parts, its cordate leaves, deeply lobed calyces, and strong odor of the foliage. This unmistakable species is so different from the others in sect. Brevantherum that one might question its inclusion here. However, the basic growth pattern of S. abutiloides is the same as that characterizing the section, while the unique, specialized features are found in more plastic parts such as leaves and hairs. Nevertheless, it remains the most distinct and one of the most specialized species in the section. Geological evidence suggests that it is also one of the most recently evolved, existing in areas of Pleistocene glaciation (Harrington, 1962; Childs & Beebe, 1963). Although Grisebach did not mention a particular collection or herbarium in his description of Cyphomandra abutiloides, the entire contribution in which the description appears was devoted to the collections made by Lorentz during his collecting in the greater Gran Chaco area (Grisebach, 1879). Morton (1976) lectotypified the species using a duplicate of the destroyed sheet in Berlin which has been annotated by Grisebach."
wfo-0001027213,"Solanum conglobatum is characterized by short, thick-stalked stem hairs. The hairs on the upper leaf surfaces are borne on groups of prominent epidermal cells and are simple and few-rayed porrect-stellate and multangulate, often vestigial-rayed; the hairs of the pedicels and calyces are partly to mostly long and thin-stalked."
wfo-0001028227,"Solanum granuloso-leprosum is distinguished by its usually obtuse, acute, or cuneate leaf bases; leaves below with partially appressed tomentum, thus making the reticulate venation usually prominent; calyx lobes with prominent midveins; and stem hairs usually appressed. Solanum granuloso-leprosum is a variable species possibly intergrading with S. mauritianum."
wfo-0001029741,"Solanum narcoticosmum is most closely related to S. dasyneuron, with which it is sympatric in high elevation Chiapas and Guatemala. It differs from that species in its smaller flowers, completely glabrous leaves and new growth, and in its somewhat lower elevation habitat. Solanum narcoticosmum is quite variable as to leaf shape; those collections with narrower leaves have been called S. fontium.  The specific epithet comes from the narcotic odor of the flowers (""narcotice olens"")."
wfo-0001025784,"Judging from the geography of its relatives, this species is likely native to northeastern Brazil, but there is no independent evidence to corroborate this. This not very conspicuous plant was collected both in Brazil and northern South America as well as the West Indies about as soon as botanical activity began in the local areas, and over a century after commerce between the areas was well under way. Solanum agrarium would attract much less attention from European botanists than did the more curious and useful S. mammosum. At the present time no firm decision can be made as to in which parts of its present range it is adventive. It is certainly a casual introduction in Alabama. One sheet mentions that the fruit is edible: ""produz frutos comestiveis"" (Zenaide 37 from Paraíba, Brazil), but perhaps this is in error, for none of the other labels mention edibility, or indeed any other uses. Field observations need to be made to determine whether it is in fact a perennial as indicated on the label of Haught 4458 from Colombia: ""from deep perennial root""."
wfo-0001027317,"Solanum cruciferum has an apparently scattered distribution and is only known from a few collections. The tiny, almost sessile inflorescences are similar to those of S. pertenue of Central America, but S. cruciferum differs from that species in its difoliate sympodia, smaller flowers, and much shorter and less copious pubescence. The bud shape of S. cruciferum, ellipsoid with an elongate, nipple-like projection, is distinctive in the S. confine species group. Bitter’s epithet refers to the 4-lobed corollas. This aberration is occasionally found in other solanums as well."
wfo-0001031287,"Solanum smithii is superficially similar to S. barbulatum (S. amblophyllum species group), also of highland Ecuador and Peru, but differs from that species in its ovoid-reniform seeds and axillary tufts of dendritic trichomes. The closest relative of S. smithii is probably S. tunariense of Andean Bolivia. Solanum smithii differs from S. tunariense in having trichomes confined to small tufts in the axils of the main lateral veins on the abaxial leaf surfaces, in its somewhat larger leaves, and in its longer fruiting pedicels."
wfo-1000031019,"Solanum sulawesi is morphologically similar to both S. involucratum and S. lasiocarpum, both of which have large, repand leaves and pubescent berries. It differs from S. involucratum in its calyx that is not accrescent in fruit, its glabrous stems and extremely sparsely pubescent leaves that are cuneate to attenuate and widest near the middle (versus truncate and widest near the base). Solanum lasiocarpum is a much more densely pubescent plant and is often completely unarmed. The leaves are more ovate in outline and more densely pubescent. The midpoints of the fruit trichomes in S. sulawesi are unusual in being 2–3-celled; those of both S. lasiocarpum and S. involucratum are single-celled. Fruits of S. sulawesi are smaller than those of S. lasiocarpum, and less densely pubescent. Solanum sulawesi is named for the island on which it appears to be endemic, Sulawesi, which is of an extraordinary composite geologic nature at the collision zone of the Asian, Pacific, and Australian tectonic plates (Villeneuve et al. 2002)."
wfo-0001029622,"Specimens of Solanum monanthemon have occasionally been identified as the more common Bolivian species S. trichoneuron Lillo. It is superficially similar to that species, but differs in its dark bark and single-flowered inflorescences, which look like a single flower on an articulate pedicel arising opposite the geminate leaves. The apparent articulation is actually the joint between the inflorescence axis and the pedicel, as evidenced by some inflorescences with minute second buds that apparently abort early on in inflorescence development. Many more collections of S. monathemon are needed to investigate this phenomenon fully. Mature fruits of S. monanthemon are not known, so placement in one of the species groups of Knapp (2002) is tentative at present. Overall morphology ( i.e. tufts of hairs in the vein axils, short anthers) suggests the S. nudum species group, but this can be misleading (e.g., S. smithii S. Knapp of the S. arenarium species group also possesses these hair tufts, see Knapp, 2002). Solanum monanthemon can be distinguished from other species with tufts of hairs in the abaxial vein axils by its single-flowered inflorescences and its tree-like habit. I t also apparently grows as isolated individuals in dense cloud forests, unlike many of the other members of the S. nudum species group that are plants of open areas along streams and roads. Etymology: From the Greek for single (mono-) flower (anthemon), referring to the unusual single-flowered inflorescences of this species."
wfo-0001026841,"Solanum capillipes is extremely similar to and probably closely related to S. valerianum of lowland western Costa Rica and Panama, sharing with that species long, curly-tipped trichomes. Solanum capillipes differs from S. valerianum in its somewhat less membranous, shiny leaves, longer inflorescences, shorter stem pubescence, and larger flowers."
wfo-0001032266,"This species is remarkable in New Caledonian solanums due to its wide range of variability in leaf shape, recalling some species of the Dulcamaroid clade. This amazing variability in leaf shape lead to the species being given four different specific epithets by various workers. Solanum vaccinioides is most similar to S. hugonis; the latter species is easily distinguished by the consistentlylanceolate to elliptic leaf shape and membranous leaf texture and by its spatulate calyx lobes. Despite the wide range of variation in leaf shape in S. vaccinioides, lobes are usually present in the species and the calyx lobes are truncate with caudate tips. Solanum vaccinioides is part of a group of native New Caledonian Solanums with relatively small leaves and short shoots which typically bear the inflorescences. This species is named for its resemblance to some species of the genus Vaccinium of the Ericaceae.
"
wfo-0001030605,"Solanum pseudodaphnopsis is recognized by its obovate, leathery, glabrous or very sparsely pubescent leaves with delicate, dendritic-echinoid trichomes. The leaves dry a distinctive olive green colour. The trichomes of S. psuedodaphnopsis are not as congested as the true echinoid trichomes found in members of the Brevantherum clade (e.g. S. erianthum or S. rugosum) or in the Solanum nitidum species group of the Dulcamaroid clade (e.g. S. storkii), but the branches are more tightly packed along the axis than other related species in the Geminata clade (Bohs, 2005). Solanum pseudodaphnopsis is most similar to S. cassioides and S. arenarium, differing from the former in its leaf shape, ovoid-reniform seens and simple inflorescences and from the latter in its larger, obovate leaves and much sparser, somewhat echinoid trichomes. Solanum cassioides is related to S. trachytrichium, both species possess peculiar thick-based trichomes not present in S. arenarium and S. pseudodaphnopsis. Solanum arenaarium is a species of upland forests, mainly on granitic hills, at elevations to ca. 300 m, while S. pseudodaphnopsis is restricted to the restinga at sea level."
wfo-0001027448,"Solanum deflexicarpum is morphologically similar to the sympatric and very widespread S. violaceum and to the Indian endemics S. hovei and S. multiflorum; in the analyses of Aubriot et al. (2016a) it is part of a monophyletic group with those species. It differs from S. violaceum in its condensed inflorescences with white rather than violet flowers and strongly down-curved fruiting pedicels; the fruiting pedicels of S. violaceum are more spaced, straight and are strongly spreading from the axis. Solanum deflexiflorum differs from S. hovei in its recurved fruiting pedicels (straight in S. hovei) and truncate, oblique (versus attenuate) leaf bases. The inflorescences of S. multiflorum are similarly condensed, but S. deflexicarpum differs from that species in its more compact trichomes, fewer flowers per inflorescence, and its distribution in southern China."
wfo-0001027315,"Solanum crotonoides is distinctive in its strongly discolorous leaves and almost lepidote pubescence. It is most similar to S. dendroicum, also of the Dominican Republic, but of much wider distribution on Hispaniola than that species. It also occurs at higher elevations in montane rather than sea level forests, and has lepidote-, rather than echinoid-, stellate pubescence. Solanum crotonoides is one of the several dioecious species of Solanum from the Caribbean, and this has been noted by several authors (Dunal, 1814) and accounts for the relatively large number of synonyms for this species. In describing S. reticulatum, Dunal (1814: 764, transl. SK) stated “This pretty species resembles greatly Solanum crotonoides, of which it has the same aspect. It is to this latter as the hermaphrodite of Solanum polygamum is to the male of the same species. It appears therefore that Solanum reticulatum is the hermaphrodite of the species where Solanum crotonoides is the male. This can be decided by observation of live plants. Even so, Solanum reticulatum differs from Solanum crotonoides in its one-flowered peduncles, larger, hermaphroditic and fertile flowers; the branches are sometimes without spines; the berries globose and mucronate.” The combination of characters found in functionally male plants is similar to that shown in other putatively dioecious species of Solanum, particularly S. dendroicum of the Samaná peninsula of the Dominican Republic."
wfo-0001027219,"Solanum conocarpum is quite similar morphologically to S. havanense, and it inhabits the same sorts of coastal habitats. The two species do not appear to be sympatric, S. havanense is found on Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, but not found in the Virgin Islands. The flowers of S. conocarpum are more stellate in outline than those of S. havanense, and usually have a distinct white eye. The fruits of the two species are completely different; S. conocarpum has very large, conical berries that are green at maturity and are borne on woody, pendant pedicels, while the berries of S. havanense are smaller, ellipsoid and dark purplish blue at maturity and are borne of erect pedicels. "
wfo-0001029021,"Knapp (1989) only knew Solanum leiophyllum from the type collection. Since then, intensive collecting in southern Ecuador by botanists from the University of Loja (LOJA) has greatly increased out knowledge of the distribution of this endemic species. It is still relatively rare geographically, but can be locally common where it is found."
wfo-0001030508,"Solanum poka is a member of the Torva clade (Aubriot et al. 2016a) and is similar to other members of the group occurring in southeast Asia such as S. pseudosaponaceum and S. torvoideum. Morphologically, S. poka most closely resembles S. pseudosaponaceum, a widespread species ranging from Taiwan and southern China to Indonesia but differs in having denser indumentum on the adaxial leaf surface, more numerous straight prickles on the upper stems, fewer, larger flowers with elongate strongly keeled calyx lobes, and much larger fruits. Flowers of S. pseudosaponaceum are lilac or purplish-white while those of S. poka are always described on labels as white. Solanum poka can be distinguished from the introduced S. torvum in its strongly keeled calyx lobes with elongate acumens (rather than deltate lobes), red (rather than green) berries, and in the lack of simple glandular trichomes in the inflorescence."
wfo-0001031795,"Solanum torvum is one of the most widespread species of spiny solanums; it occurs throughout the tropics and subtropics worldwide, and is very common where it occurs, often being the dominant Solanum species in the environment. It is a member of the Torva clade (Stern et al. 2011) and native to the New World. In the Caribbean and eastern Central America it is very common in disturbed areas a low elevations, it also occurs in northeaster South America to coastal Brazil, where it is common in low restingas near the coast. Solanum torvum could be confused with many native species of Solanum in the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly those in the non-andromonecious Anguivi grade, but can be distinguished by the combination of fruit green at maturity, inflorescences with small simple, gland-tipped trichomes, perfect flowers, and broadly elliptic to ovate leaves. Solanum anguivi in particular is also widespread, but is distinguished from S. torvum by its red fruit and smaller flowers (8-15 mm in diameter versus 15-20 mm)."
wfo-0001028323,"Solanum havanense is a striking plant, with its large purple flowers and bright purplish blue fruits. It was brought into cultivation in Europe and appears to have been spread widely amongst botanic gardens (see synonyms), with some loss of information as to its original provenance. The flowers of S. havanense expand through anthesis, with the corolla lobes becoming both larger and more divided with time (shown clearly in Hooker, 1827). The corolla color also fades from bright to pale purple, and the lobe orientation becomes more planar. "
wfo-0001030511,"Solanum polyacanthon is usually a densely prickly shrub, but two collections from Hispaniola (Ekman H.3475, the type of Solanum tortipes, and Ekman 12586) are either without or almost completely without prickles. Many of the other Caribbean solanums (e.g. S. tetramerum, S. bahamense) are also extremely variable in prickle density; this may be related to microhabitat in some way, with plants growing in more mesic situations being less prickly. The tiny red fruits of Solanum polyacanthon borne in very short to sessile inflorescences are distinctive, as are the very small flowers and the small, linear to lanceolate leaves usually bearing yellow, acicular prickles; this species is not easily confused with any other in the region. Solanum polyacanthon was originally published as Solanum polyacanthos by Lamarck, but this is a correctable orthographic error in Greek ending."
wfo-0001031492,"Solanum storkii, though of restricted distribution, is locally very common, often forming pure stands above the tree line in the Cordillera de Talamanca in Costa Rica and Panama. Its distribution within its range, however, is somewhat patchy, and stands are commoner in open areas or in the later stages of second growth. Solanum storkii had previously been confused with S. cutervanum (as S. pulverulentum, see Standley & Morton, 1938), but is quite distinct from that species. It can be distinguished from the rest of the members of the Solanum nitidum group in its sparse pubescence of echinoid trichomes, which in dry specimens appear to be in pits on the lower leaf surface, and in its deltate calyx lobes."
wfo-0001027807,"Although Solanum elvasioides is only known from fruiting material, I am describing it here in order that flowering material might be sought. It must be a very rare species, as the numerous collections made in the vicinity of Loja in the last decades by collectors from the University of Aarhus and the Missouri Botanical Garden have only revealed two specimens (cited here). These collections are about 10 km apart on the western slope of the north-south ridge west of Loja (the continental divide), where the terrain drops steeply to the deep, dry Catamayo valley (D. Neill, pers. comm.). Solanum elvasioides is superficially similar to S. barbulatum Zahlbr. and S. smithii S. Knapp, both of which occur in the same general region of southern Ecuador, but the tightly spaced, parallel leaf venation and total glabrousness of S. elvasioides are distinctive. It is likely to belong to the S. amblophyllum species group (sensu Knapp, 2002), with other taxa from high elevations with flattened reniform seeds. The S. amblophyllum species group is one of the few species groups from Knapp (2002) that may be monophyletic (J.C. Granados-Tochoy, pers. comm.). A preliminary conservation assessment of S. elvasioides would be Endangered (EN), based on its very small range (2 currently known populations 10 km apart, so extent of occurrence <100 km2, see IUCN, 2001) and the threat from fire spreading into its montane forest habitat from the drier forests in the heavily populated Catamayo valley (see Kessler, 1992 for a discussion of threats to the forests of southwestern Ecuador)."
wfo-0001026229,"Solanum anisocladum is a species with a robust habit, forming small trees up to 5 m tall, with the upper leaf surface shiny, dark green, and drying dark. It is similar to Solanum megalochiton which normally forms much branched shrubs up to 3 m tall , with the surface matte, often covered by a whitish-yellow indument, and normally pale green when dried. Both species share an inflated calyx that is strongly accrescent at fruit maturity (Fig. 3D). This feature was previously used to separate S. megalochiton from similar species such as S. didymum Dunal. However, S. anisocladum presents several other characters that readily distinguish it from S. megalochiton. Its indument of very long stellate and unbranched hairs reaching more than 2 mm long and is ferruginous when dry (Figs. 1, 2A-B in Giacomin et al. 2013) is easily visible to the naked eye. The old growth becomes somewhat hirsute to hispid where only the multiseriate stalks of the stellate trichomes remain. The indument in S. megalochiton is much softer, reaches up to 1.5 mm long, is normally transparent to yellowish when dried, and the stems never become hispid. The inflorescence is also a distinctively robust unbranched cyme, sometimes with an axis reaching more than 4 cm long, whereas the inflorescences of S. megalochiton are normally shorter than 2.5 cm. Its adaxial leaf indument is composed of eglandular porrect-stellate trichomes associated with unbranched hairs, the latter with multicellular bases, apparently representing stellate hairs without developed lateral rays. The adaxial leaf indument of S. megalochiton is composed only of stellate hairs, these sometimes glandular. Solanum anisocladum also has a distinctive branching pattern not observed in S. megalochiton. When arising from between the nodes, the inflorescences can invoke a strong change in growth direction (not always visible on small branches in herbarium sheets, but observed in every specimen seen at the field). In contrast, the flowering branches of S. megalochiton are more or less straight."
wfo-0001029406,"Solanum maturecalvans is closely related and morphologically similar to S. ochrophyllum of Bolivia and S Peru and S. nigricans of Mexico and Central America. Populations from the Cuzco area have larger, more conspicuously bullate leaves, but are otherwise similar to the rest of the species. Solanum maturecalvans is easily recognisable due to its conspicuous felty pubescence which appears to slough off in an irregular fashion and the leaves with revolute margins narrowing abruptly to the petiole (the basis for Bitter’s epithet crotalobasis). Older leaves are more glabrous than younger ones, thus Bitter's choice of specific epithet. Solomon 8488 from the Río Zongo valley in Bolivia has huge leaves and is much more pubescent than the rest of the specimens I have seen. It may represent a new species but is only just outside the range of variation found in this quite variable species. I have not seen the type specimen of Solanum kieslingii, from NW Argentina, nor any of the material cited in the original description (Legname & Cuezzo 5954 (LIL, LP), Fabris et al. 3104 (LP) and de la Sota 4418 (LP) - all from the type locality). It appears to be a synonym of S. maturecalvans from the description, and fits well within the wide range of variation of the species. The illustration in the original description (Cabrera, 1978), however, is of a plant with unifoliate sympodia. Many collections of S. maturecalvans from elsewhere in its range apper to have unifoliate sympodia, but this is due to the loss of the minor leaf in drying or specimen preparation. These populations in NW Argentina and adjacent Bolivia merit closer study and may also deserve recognition as a distinct species. "
wfo-0001027354,"Solanum cutervanum had long been confused with and placed in the synonymy of S. nitidum. Specimens of both these species were previously annotated as S. pulverulentum Pers., perhaps due to their superficial similarity and sympatric distribution. The two species, however, are very different. Solanum cutervanum has golden or brownish tree-like trichomes on stems, leaves and inflorescences and black berries, while S. nitidum has more delicate, greyish, strictly dendritic trichomes and red ripe berries. Solanum cutervanum is closely related to S. ruizii, also from central Peru. It differs from that species in its often dichasial branching, rounded leaf bases, smaller flowers and deltate calyx lobes. These sister taxa are sympatric and flower size may contribute to reproductive isolation. Some populations of S. cutervanum from N Peru have broadly elliptical leaves superficially reminiscent of S. aureum Dunal, a vining species with golden pubescence. Solanum aureum, however, does not possess the sleeve-like pedicel insertion characteristic of the Solanum nitidum group. "
wfo-0001032258,"Solanum urubambaense is characterized by ferruginous to reddish indument with glandular-stellate, somewhat stiff and deciduous, trichomes; many-flowered inflorescences (40-many- flowers); pedicels leaving small pegs, 1-1.5 mm long, on the rachis after falling; and the ovary strigose, with sharp, adpressed and somewhat stiff trichomes. This species resembles and probably is related to S. abutilifolium from Bolivia, which also has many-flowered inflorescences and flowers with corollas blue to violet. It differs, however, by lack of characters that are present in S. abutilifolium: a persistent lanuginose yellowish to whitish indument on the entire plant; leaf blades with stellate-glandular sessile trichomes above with the central ray many-celled and glandular at the apex; pedicels without small pegs; corolla lobes very short, 1-2 mm long; the ovary lanuginose covered by stellate trichomes with a long 4-6-celled central ray, glandular at the apex. The epithet urubambaense refers to the Urubamba River, Peru."
wfo-0001031202,"With the exception of Solanum oppositifolium, S. sessile is the most widespread and variable of the species of this group. It is most closely related (Knapp, 1991b) to S. obovalifolium (Cordillera de la Costa, Venezuela) and S. monadelphum (E Andean slope, Peru). Solanum sessile differs from the former in its much more complexly branched inflorescences, larger, fleshier flowers, and large, obovate, usually sessile leaves. It differs from S. monadelphum in its larger leaves, inflorescences, and flowers. Solanum sessile rarely grows in the riverbed habitat of S. monadelphum. In the forests of Quincemil (Dept. Cuzco, Peru), intermediates between S. sessile and S. monadelphum occur (see discussion of S. monadelphum). The most distinctive features of S. sessile are its large, branched inflorescences, and large, fleshy flowers. Solanum sessile is a widespread species, with several well marked geographical races. These are briefly described here. 1) Populations from near Muña, in middle elevation central Peru, have strongly sessile leaves, congested inflorescences with little or no axis between the flowers, and very large, fleshy flowers. Ruiz and Pavón's collection of Solanum sessile is from this area, an isolated Andean valley in the department of Huánuco. 2) In areas of central Peru (not including the above area near Muña), plants are quite similar in appearance to the preceeding form, but the inflorescences are open and many times branched, with somewhat smaller flowers. Most collections from middle to high elevation Peru are of this form. 3) More northern, lower elevation populations in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela consist of plants with sessile leaves, the two leaves of the geminate pair markedly differing from one another, elongate, branched inflorescences, and pubescent berries. These populations have been called Pheliandra herthae and Solanum grandifolium.  4) Low elevation Brazilian populations with open branched inflorescences and glabrous berries are of two types, a) those with sessile leaves have been called Solanum marmellosanum, and b) those with petiolate leaves have been called S. pulchrum.  5) Plants from southeastern Peru and adjacent Brazil are almost completely glabrous, have sessile, geminate leaves, and glabrous berries. These populations grade into and are perhaps hybridizing with Solanum monadelphum.  6) Plants from high elevation Venezuela have coriaceous, sessile leaves that are often somewhat auriculate, and large open inflorescences. Many other forms of even more local occurrence could be described. To give formal names to the elements of this complex mosaic of variation would be counterproductive, and would only serve to confuse an already confusing situation. The above well marked forms grade into one another, and the collection sample is quite small for this forest species. Although perhaps difficult for the field botanist, it is more realistic phylogenetically to leave this complex pattern under the name of Solanum sessile until detailed work is done on the complex. Individuals of Solanum sessile are most likely andromonoecious, as they bear both long- and short-styled flowers. Few berries are set on any given inflorescence, lending support to this hypothesis. The sympodial structure of S. sessile is quite variable (see above and description), some plants have difoliate, geminate sympodia, while others appear to have plurifoliate sympodia (for discussion of sympodial types, see Knapp, 2002). This difference largely depends on the part of the plant taken to make the specimen in question. If only the most recent inflorescence is taken, the sympodia appear plurifoliate, and the inflorescence terminal, with no shoot growth continuing. On the other hand, if a lower node is taken, the inflorescence appears to be opposite the leaf, and the sympodium difoliate and geminate. Solanum sessile is a good example of the difficulties involved in using inflorescence position to identify species in section Geminata. This single species has been placed in two subgenera due to this variability."
wfo-1000025655,"Athenaea hunzikeriana is easily recognised by its purple, eglandular-pubescent mature fruits on erect or spreading pedicels, its large seeds and the distinctive inflorescences with a short but persistent axis. Other species of Athenaea have axillary fascicles, with no rhachis along which pedicel scars can be observed. This species is morphologically similar to and sympatric with A. pogogena, with which it shares almost all flower characteristics, but can be distinguished by its subglobose (versus conic or ovoid) berry and leaf pubescence of mostly eglandular trichomes with sparse minute glandular trichomes, rather than densely glandular pubescent leaves. Athenaea hunzikeriana is also vegetatively similar to A. anonacea Sendtn. and A. martiana Sendtn. in having pubescent leaves but is differentiated from both those species by its pubescent fruit and non-accrescent fruiting calyx. It is also sympatric with A. fasciculata but differs from that species in its conspicuous pubescence (A. fasciculata is glabrous).
"
wfo-0001030884,"Solanum robustum is a native of eastern South America and may have been introduced to Africa as an ornamental, as it has been elsewhere (Wagner et al. 1999) for its attractive leaves. It has been classed as a noxious weed in Hawai'i (HDOA 1992), where it was first seen in 1977 (Wagner et al. 1999). The earliest African collection of S. robustum we have seen is from 1909 the Amani area in Tanzania (Braun 2217, EA). Most other collections are from the latter half of the 20th century, perhaps indicating its spread and possible invasive status. This species should be kept under observation for invasiveness, and control contemplated. The strongly decurrent leaf bases of S. robustum make this species similar to the African Gboma eggplant S. macrocarpon and its wild progenitor S. dasyphyllum. It can be distinguished from those taxa by its softly pubescent leaves, small greenish white stellate flowers and pubescent fruits. Both S. macrocarpon and S. dasyphyllum have larger, rotate flowers and glabrous fruit; S. macrocarpon usually has glabrous or only sparsely pubescent leaves, while S. dasyphyllum is coarsely hairy. Solanum robustum is superficially similar to many other African native species with softly hairy leaves and occasionally somewhat decurrent leaf bases such as S. campylacanthum, S. cerasiferum, S. lichtensteinii, and S. umtuma. The strongly decurrent winged leaf bases, small greenish white stellate corollas and densely pubescent fruits distinguish S. robustum from all these species; the latter have leaves that are not decurrent onto the winged stem, more rotate purple or white flowers, and glabrous fruits."
wfo-0001031842,"Solanum trichoneuron is most similar to and probably closely related to S. aphyodendron of northern South and Central America. It differs from S. aphyodendron in its longer, often more terminal inflorescences, smaller flowers, quadrate calyx lobes, and smaller berries. Solanum trichoneuron can grow to be a large tree in Tucumán, reaching 20 cm in diam. The wood, however, is too soft to be of any use commercially. Few collections of S. trichoneuron from Bolivia exist, but the species is common in northwesternmost Argentina. The ranges of S. aphyodendron and S. trichoneuron nearly abut, and the species are very similar. They are perhaps allopatric or parapatric derivatives of a single ancestral taxon."
wfo-0001030638,"Solanum psychotrioides is probably most closely related to S. vacciniiflorum of high elevation Costa Rica, and to S. validinervium of high elevation Venezuela. The trichomes on all three of these species are of similar morphology and structure: they are often branched, have weak walls, and dry reddish. Solanum psychotrioides differs from those species in its dense indument of papillose trichomes on the new growth, and in its elongate, woody, rugose fruiting pedicels. Solanum psychotrioides is variable in pubescence, with some populations possessing only papillate trichomes, and others possessing both papillate and uniseriate, both branched and simple, trichomes on the new growth and leaf undersides. As with many of the species of section Geminata, the usefulness of trichome characters is difficult to assess, and are not immediately useful in identification of some particularly variable species. "
wfo-0001029402,"Solanum matadori is thus far known only from two collections from Santa Catarina, Brazil. It is most similar to two other southeastern Brazilian species, S. fusiforme and S. luridifuscescens. All three species have scaly or papillose pubescence on the abaxial anther surfaces, with these papillae most obvious in S. luridifuscescens. Solanum matadori and S. fusiforme are similar in having branched inflorescences and in being nearly glabrous vegetatively. Solanum fusiforme has distinctive elongated ovaries and fruits. Fruits of S. matadori are unknown, but the ovaries appear to be elongated. Solanum matadori differs from S. fusiforme in its narrower and strictly simple leaves, pubescent corollas, and glabrous petioles. Solanum matadori, unlike S. luridifuscescens, has very narrow leaves, branched inflorescences, and corolla lobes that are pubescent adaxially as well as abaxially."
wfo-0001347627,"Solanum sessilantherum can be distinguished from other members of the S. asterophorum species group by a suite of characters: its armed inflorescence axis (Fig. 5D, B), pedicels straight or nearly so, with the buds erect to horizontally spreading, relatively distantly spaced pedicel insertion points (Fig. 5A, B), apparently sessile anthers with inconspicuous filaments (Fig. 5B), obloid to transversely elliptic (length to width ratio 5:6–2:3) berries (Fig. 5D), and coriaceous leaves. Solanum sessilantherum is morphologically very similar to S. asterophorum (especially those specimens of S. asterophorum with sparser indumentum) in overall appearance. However, S.
asterophorum can be distinguished from S. sessilantherum by its unarmed inflorescence axis, downwardly curved pedicels with the buds pointing down and the pedicel insertion points very closely and evenly spaced (Fig. 1B, F) making the inflorescence more congested."
wfo-0001347626,"Solanum igniferum is unique in the S. asterophorum species group due to the notable orange to ferruginous indumentum of its adaxial leaf surfaces, midrib of both leaf sides, calyces, pedicels, inflorescence axis, and young stems, its plagiotropic branches sprawling horizontally, and the straight or nearly straight pedicels with erect to horizontally oriented buds (see Fig. 3). Solanum igniferum resembles S. asterophorum, but the indumentum of S. asterophorum is hyaline, yellowish or somewhat brown, the branches are erect and the pedicels curved downward with the buds pointing downwards. Solanum igniferum also resembles S. piluliferum in its somewhat similar colored indumentum, but the cupuliform calyx and entire leaves of S. piluliferum readily distinguish it from S. igniferum."
wfo-0001026364,"Solanum asterophorum differs from other species of the S. asterophorum species group in the combination of obconic calyces with curved pedicels which hold the flower buds pointing down (see Figs. 1B, F). The latter character can sometimes be difficult to observe in herbarium sheets, once the pressing process influences the position of the buds. Thus, in order to facilitate identification, this character should be noted at the time of collection and included in the label observations when possible. Solanum asterophorum is morphologically similar to S. igniferum and S. sessilantherum, with which it shares lobed leaves and the obconic calyx. Solanum igniferum differs from S. asterophorum in its notable orange rather than sparse hyaline indumentum, plagiotropic rather than erect branches, erect to spreading rather than downward pointing buds and its more lax inflorescences. From S. sessilantherum, S. asterophorum can be distinguished by its downward pointing rather than spreading buds; its congested inflorescences with
unarmed axes rather than lax inflorescences with armed axes; its coriaceous rather than membranous leaves; and anthers borne on distinct filaments rather than being sessile. Solanum asterophorum has the most variable morphology among the species belonging to the S. asterophorum species group, and also the widest latitudinal range. Occurring from the states of Rio de Janeiro State to Paraíba, its populations vary mainly with respect to the indumentum of the stems, leaves, reproductive structures, and the coloration of the epidermis when dry. There is a great variation in trichome density, color, and length of trichome stalks and midpoints. The indumentum density ranges from nearly glabrous to dense, with interwoven trichome rays, stalks, or both. The trichomes can be sessile to long-stalked, with midpoints obsolete to longer than the rays. Trichomes also vary in coloration from hyaline to yellow or brown-tinged, and they are rarely somewhat ochraceous. When dry, the color of the leaf epidermis can range from green to black, and specimens of intermediate coloration are common."
wfo-0001030412,"Solanum piluliferum is easily differentiated from other species in the S. asterophorum species group by its cupuliform calyx with short deltate lobes, which is usually densely covered with long-stalked stellate trichomes (Fig. 2B), entire leaves with acuminate apices (Fig. 2C) and sparsely armed stems with short, straight, deltate, flattened prickles. Although the adult individuals have entire leaves, juvenile plants may have lobed leaves and often possess a distinct reddish indumentum on the younger portions of their stems and leaves. In contrast to other species in the group, herbarium material made from distal reproductive shoots may lack prickles. The stramineous to ochraceo-ferruginous indumentum of the young stems also can help to differentiate S. piluliferum, especially from S. igniferum; S. piluliferum is ocher or red in the distal and younger portions of the stems and in immature leaves, which usually become evenly stramineous when older, while S. igniferum has young stems and adaxial leaf surfaces evenly orange to ferruginous, without a marked differentiation between younger and older parts.
Solanum piluliferum is found in higher and cooler areas than other members of the group. Most specimens have been collected above 600 m elevation, and the species usually only occurs below this range in cooler regions (e.g. Gouvêa & Falcão 138, collected at 282 m elevation, near the municipality of Santa Maria Madalena in the State of Rio de Janeiro)."
wfo-0001027389,"Solanum darienense is related to S. confine, a species of the Andean foothills in eastern Peru, and to S. pertenue of montane Costa Rica and western Panama. Solanum darienense is distinct from these two species in its reddish-golden bark, lightly winged stems, obtuse, slightly oblique leaf bases, and generally glabrous leaves."
wfo-0001029236,"Solanum macbridei is morphologically the most distinctive member of the Solanum nitidum group, if not in the entire genus Solanum. It is distinctive in its campanulate corolla and in its small, coriaceous leaves. Sheets of this species have been identified as members of the Gentianaceae, Ericaceae and as the genus Fabiana (Solanaceae). The pedicel sleeve characteristic of the Solanum nitidum species group is most pronounced in S. macbridei, partly because the inflorescence is completely glabrous and thus the character is more easily visible than in other more pubescent species in the group. The coriaceous leaves of S. albescens are almost certainly related to its high elevation habitat, as are those of S. macbridei. "
wfo-0001022513,"Lycianthes schizocalyx is one of several Asian species of Lycianthes with more than 5 (usually 10) calyx appendages. It is most similar to L. biflora in its shrubby habit, the usually sublate or linear calyx appendages, flowers held below the leaves maturing to erect fruits, and in its elliptic, ovate or narrowly elliptic leaves. Pubescence varies throughout the range of L. schizocalyx, as it does in most of these species, and the splitting of the calyx tube occurs often in L. schizocalyx but is not unique to the species. Lycianthes schizocalyx can be distinguished from L. biflora – sometimes with difficulty – by its usually fewer-flowered fascicles, calyx appendages that differ in length within a flower and some of which arise from below the calyx tube rim, the usually strongly ribbed calyx tube (although this can be the case in L. biflora as well) and flowering pedicel length [(1)2–3 cm long in L. schizocalyx versus 0.9–1.2 cm long in L. biflora]. The flowering pedicel length is the most consistent character separating the two taxa, along with the insertion of the calyx appendages, but that can sometimes be difficult to see in poorly prepared material. In general, L. schizocalyx is found at higher elevations than L. biflora, but this is not consistent across the range of L. biflora. These two species may hybridise, but this has not been verified. Lycianthes lysimachioides is sometimes confused with L. schizocalyx. The two species have similar calyx appendages; these reliably emerge below the rim in L. lysimachioides and often emerge below the rim in L. schizocalyx. Lycianthes schizocalyx can be distinguished from L. lysimachioides by its shrubby habit (versus prostrate herb rooting at the nodes), calyx appendages of variable length in a single flower (versus of equal length), and larger berries (1–1.3 cm versus 0.6–0.8 cm in diameter). In addition, L. lysimachioides usually has one-flowered inflorescences and leaves of a geminate pair often the same size and shape (appearing opposite). Lycianthes shunningensis also has 10 calyx appendages, but these are strongly reflexed; those of L. schizocalyx are erect or spreading."
wfo-0001032569,"The strongly bullate leaves and the dense dendritic pubescence make this species very distinctive. The trichomes are slender and very highly branched, and the branches themselves are very short. Solanum youngii is closely related to S. nutans, also of the Andean cloud forests, but differs from it in its looser, less tightly branched pubescence, bullate leaves and difoliate geminate sympodial units. The pale coffee-colored pubescence is very similar to that of S. malletii, but that species has elongate inflorescences, auriculate leaves and is found at low elevations. Dillon et al. 6131, from Cutervo, Peru, has a very large and complex branched inflorescence and peculiar verrucose berries. The leaves on this specimen are also much larger than those from other collections throughout the range of the species and the plant may be aberrant or represent a new species."
wfo-0001027299,"Solanum crinitipes is very similar to S. glutinosum. Both species can be densely prickly, but the prickles of S. crinitipes are narrow and acicular and some are bristle-like and tipped with stellae. The hairs of S. crinitipes lack glandular midpoints, in contrast to the gland-tipped hairs of S. glutinosum. Pubescence in S. glutinosum is usually reddish, whereas that of S. crinitipes is whitish. This species shows especially well the origin of prickles in subgen. Leptostemonum from the multiseriate stalks of the stellate hairs. On the stems there is a complete, intergrading series from short-stalked stellate hairs through long-stalked ones and then smaller bristle-like prickles through to the largest prickles which are only stellate-tipped in the youngest stages before the stellate tip is broken off. The name “crinitipes” refers to the similarity to S. crinitum Lam. which also sometimes has long, bristle-like hairs; the epithets are ultimately from the term “crinitus”, meaning with long hairs, like hairs of the head. Solanum crinitum is a species of the lowlands of the Amazon, basin, especially the periphery, but that species has a much larger, permanently tomentose fruit and belongs to the sect. Crinitum (Nee, 1999). Robust individuals of S. crinitipes are especially reminiscent of S. crinitum because of the dense cover of pale stellate hairs and the leaf shape."
wfo-0001031036,"Solanum santosii is most similar to S. warmingii and S. caavurana, also of southeastern Brazil. It differs from those species in its much smaller flowers and smaller calyx lobes. Both S. warmingii and S. caavurana have expanded, petaloid, calyx lobes. Neither of those two species grows in the wet forest of coastal Bahia, the habitat of S. santosii.  Solanum santosii has only been collected in the CEPEC forest inventory plot between Ilhéus and Itabuna. This area is somewhat secondary in nature (de Carvalho, pers. comm.) and I suspect S. santosii grows in light gaps in the forest as do many other members of the S. nudum species group. It is apparently not a common plant, and it is surprising that it had not been collected before 1978, having been overlooked by the numerous botanists who have worked around the city of Ilhéus since the early 1800's."
wfo-0001429802,"Similar to S. thomasiifolium Sendtn., but differing from it by the corollas completely lacking interpetalar tissue, fruiting calyx lobes exceeding the fruit length, fruit covered by sessile to subsessile glandular-stellate trichomes with midpoints much longer than the lateral rays, and scarce and inconspicuous simple trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface; it is also similar to S. buddleiifolium Sendtn., differing by having wider (4–6–10 cm) elliptic leaves, white corollas, and hirsute to glabrescent epicarp of the fruit."
wfo-0001027221,"Solanum consimile is very similar in many ways to S. caricaefolium Rusby, and when in fruit they can be difficult to tell apart. In the northern limit of the species around Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, it is sympatric with the southernmost populations of S. caricaefolium. Individual herbarium specimens from this region are sometimes difficult to assign to species and definite hybrid swarms have been found. Solanum consimile can generally be recognized by the dense, viscid indumentum, and the corolla is pale blue or violet (vs. white in S. caricaefolium). The viscid indument of S. consimile gives the plants a distinctive wet dog odor, which is especially perceptible in wet weather.
"
wfo-0001027901,"Solanum falconense is closely related to S. lucens with which it shares shiny, obovate major leaves with keeled midribs that dry russet brown and the keeled midrib. Solanum falconense differs from S. lucens in its pubescent leaves and translucent yellow berry on a deflexed fruiting pedicel. The bright green seeds in translucent yellow fruits are unusual in section Geminata and are probably related to dispersal mechanism. Most species of section Geminata with green fruit are dispersed by bats or small rodents but those with brightly colored fruit are bird-dispersed. Solanum falconense may also be bird dispersed, as it possesses relatively brightly colored fruits. Solanum falconense is apparently confined to the isolated cloud forests of the Sierra San Luis in northwestern Venezuela. This is one of the centers of endemism in Venezuela detailed by Steyermark (1979)."
wfo-0001031656,"Solanum tanysepalum is closely related and vegetatively extremely similar to S. ripense of western Andean Venezuela. Sterile specimens are nearly impossible to distinguish. Solanum ripense however, is a large treelet to 10 m tall in high cloud forest above 2000 m, while S. tanysepalum is always a small shrub of forest understory at somewhat lower elevations. Solanum tanysepalum is easily distinguished from S. ripense when reproductive by its sessile inflorescences, strongly five-ridged pedicels, long-acuminate calyx lobes, and often elliptic berries. Solanum tanysepalum grows in forests with S. ombrophilum (S. confine species group), but is usually the less common where the two occur together."
wfo-0001029769,"Solanum nematorhachis is related to S. tenuiflagellatum and S. leptorhachis, both of which share extremely long inflorescences with this species. It differs from those species by the characters in the key. Solanum nematorhachis occurs at higher elevations than S. leptorhachis, the only other similar species with which it is potentially sympatric."
wfo-0001032157,"Solanum tuerckheimii is related to S. pastillum, also of montane Costa Rica. It is distinct from that species in its rough, shaggy, red bark, its smaller flowers and deltoid calyx lobes, and by the golden cast its leaf undersides take on when dry. In Monteverde, Costa Rica, S. tuerckheimii is a shrub of forest understory, occurring in drier forest than most of the other species at the site (see Knapp, 1986a for description of the site). The flowers of S. tuerckheimii in Monteverde are pollinated by Bombus ephippiatus, but the plants do not set large numbers of fruit. Visits by Bombus are rare."
wfo-0001030822,"Solanum restingae is a distinctive species with its strongly winged stems, completely glabrous mature foliage, indistinct calyx lobes, and cucullate corolla lobe apices. Within the S. nudum species group it is most similar and probably most closely related to S. daphnophyllum of eastern Bolivia. Solanum restingae differs from S. daphnophyllum in its difoliate sympodial units, larger flowers with strongly hooded corolla lobes and strongly winged stems. Such strongly hooded corolla lobe apices are also found in S. cucullatum, an unrelated species of section Geminata (S. robustifrons species group) from premontane forests in western Ecuador. The habitat of Solanum restingae is disturbed arboreal restinga on white sand near sea level. The species is apparently of extremely restricted distribution, and has only been collected in a tiny area off the Valença-Guaibim road and on the Isla de Tinharé. Large areas of the restingas of Bahia remain unexplored, however, so more collections may show it to be of somewhat wider distribution. Many interesting species have been collected from the arboreal or shrubby restingas on white sand soils in Bahia (de Carvalho, pers. comm.; Plowman, 1987)."
wfo-0001026734,"Solanum caelicolum resembles S. hirtellum, sharing with it a similar habit and stem indument, leading to misidentifications of collections from Espírito Santo state in the past. It can be distinguished by its elliptic leaves, not ovate like those of S. hirtellum, that are glabrescent and usually drying dark adaxially (normally moderately pubescent and pale green in S. hirtellum), abaxially drying somewhat grey to pale green due to the conspicuous indument (normally inconspicuously pubescent and pale green in S. hirtellum). The adaxial leaf trichomes are also distinct from those of S. hirtellum. While S. caelicolum has porrect-stellate trichomes with a very reduced midpoint (central ray; Fig. 2H in Giacomin et al. 2013), S. hirtellum mostly has stellae with the central ray sometimes multicellular and longer than the lateral rays on the upper leaf surfaces. Some variation in trichome morphology occurs in S. hirtellum, but at least some of the hairs of the adaxial leaf surfaces have a central ray longer than the lateral ones. Solanum caelicolum also has a distinctive sessile to subsessile congested and unbranched inflorescence (Fig. 3F in Giacomin et al. 2013) with the pedicels arising very close to each other (the rachis almost absent), whereas the inflorescence in S. hirtellum is mainly pedunculate, few- to many-branched, and lax, with the pedicels arising up to 0.5 cm from each other. Pedicel size can also be used to distinguish both species; they are up to 8 mm long in S. caelicolum and frequently exceed 8 mm in S. hirtellum. Another good character to distinguish the two species is the size of the fruiting calyx lobes. In S. caelicolum the calyx lobes are larger than the diameter of the mature berry, whereas in S. hirtellum the calyx lobes are shorter than the mature berry. Both species are known from Espírito Santo state, but they apparently do not co-occur. While S. caelicolum seems to be restricted to north-central Espírito Santo, S. hirtellum has a much broader distribution, extending from northeast Argentina and Paraguay and reaching its northernmost limit in the south of Espírito Santo.
"
wfo-0001031062,"Before more material became available and fieldwork demonstrated the difference of the two species, Nee & Solomon 34054 and J. Steinbach 8343 were considered to belong to S. comarapanum. The two are nearly sympatric, but S. saturatum grows in clearings in cloud forest, whereas S. comarapanum is more likely to be found on shrubby roadsides in drier woodland just below this cloud forest zone. The leaves of S. saturatum never develop the complex lobing found in S. comarapanum. Solanum saturatum is morphologically somewhat similar to the local expression of S. asperolanatum Ruiz & Pav. (often annotated as its synonym Solanum hispidum Pers.), but this species in the Siberia area of Bolivia has long-stipitate stellate hairs giving it a distinctly bristly appearance, and its inflorescence does not begin branching near the base, but instead in the more distal half of the inflorescence. Etymology: The epithet saturatum refers to the thick sweet fragrance of the flowers, an odor rare elsewhere in Solanum, but also found in related species of the S. torvum group from Department La Paz, Bolivia into Peru."
wfo-0001028424,"Solanum hirtum can be distinguished from other members of section Lasiocarpa by its gland-tipped stellate hairs, reflexed calyx lobes, and small leaves and fruits. The hairs do not rub off the ripe fruits. Solanum hirtum is the most widespread and variable species of section Lasiocarpa. Extending from Mexico through Cental America, Colombia, and Venezuela to Trinidad, its diverse forms have received at least six species names. The most variable network of populations is found in northern Colombia and Venezuela, where many extremes can be recognized. Many coastal lowland populations in Venezuela consist of without prickles or sparsely prickly plants with broad, sinuate-repand leaves and pentagonal-stellate corollas with well developed interpetalar tissue. In the interior llanos of Venezuela, plants are often coarsely armed with unusually large and numerous, broad-based prickles on stems, petioles, and leaves. A high elevation race in the cordillera of western Venezuela has the large, coarse prickles common in the llano plants, a dense vestiture of stalked stellate hairs, and fleshy protuberances at the base of the calyx in fruit. This form extends into northeastern Colombia in mountains of Santander and Norte de Santander. Plants with prominently velutinous calyces occur sporadically in Trinidad. In Colombia, collections from the Magdalena Valley and northern coastal lowlands from Cartagena to Santa Marta have densely acicular-prickly stems and stellae with capitate-glandular midpoints on stems and pedicels. The stellae of adaxial leaf-surfaces often appear simple with reduced lateral rays and relatively elongate midpoints. Many other forms more local in occurrence could be described. It would be counterproductive to attempt to provide formal names for the many variants of S. hirtum. Even the major races listed above are not clearly delimitable entities. Instead, a complex mosaic of variation is observed in which certain regional norms emerge. Studies of plants growing under uniform greenhouse conditions have confirmed that differences among representative accessions of forms 1, 3, and 5 are genetically controlled and cannot be explained as environmentally induced variation. The high altitude form (3) is particularly interesting, because it is the only race with clear ecological integrity and is the most distinctive morphologically. A multivariate mapping of variation in seven characters, based on principal component analysis, has been used to visualize the distribution of this race. Characters scored include cauline prickle length, width of cauline prickles at base, cauline prickle density, stalk length of cauline stellae, stalk length of pedicel stellae, glandularity of pedicel stellae, and presence of calyx protuberances. Most of the high elevation plants have extreme values on the first principal component axis, but a few of them are much like lowland forms. Conversely, occasional lowland populations approach their highland relatives in morphology. The distinction between the highland race and low elevation populations of S. hirtum is not sharp. The actual mosaic pattern of variation is illustrated in Figure 28 of Whalen et al. (1981). The relation between low and high-elevation population systems may be one of incipient speciation. Heiser (1972) reported a strong barrier to crossability between accessions of S. hirtum from Costa Rica and Trinidad, plants rather similar in morphology. In the present study, crosses have been attempted between accessions of races 1 and 3, highly divergent forms both morphologically and ecologically. These crosses were uniformly successful and produced abundant viable seed, but fertility of hybrid plants has not yet been tested. Thus, initial evolution of internal crossability barriers may bear little relation to patterns of morphological and ecological differentiation. Solanum hirtum will be an interesting subject for studies on early stages of speciation in section Lasiocarpa. The spotty distribution of S. hirtum in Mexico and Central America may reflect relatively recent multiple introductions from South America. Centers of establishment in Central America are Honduras, the state of Guanacaste in Costa Rica, and the Darién of Panama. In and around each of these centers, populations of the species are strikingly uniform in morphology. Between them, the distribution appears to be sharply discontinuous. In Mexico, separate introductions may have occurred in Yucatán and Veracruz. Extensive variation in Colombia and Venezuela and the presence of related species there point to that region as the center of origin of S. hirtum. An interesting pattern of fruit-bursting has been observed in accessions of S. hirtum under greenhouse cultivation. The pericarp of ripe berries regularly splits in a neat, circumscissile fashion. The suture may be either equatorial or meridional. Since this behavior has not been seen in the field, we assume that berries are generally harvested by frugivores before reaching this stage. What significance this regular pattern of fruit-bursting may have in the reproductive biology of the species is unknown.
"
wfo-0001030250,"Solanum pastillum is related to S. tuerckheimii, also of montane central Costa Rica (but extending into Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico). The two species share the understory habitat, long inflorescences of greenish-white flowers with reflexed petals at anthesis, and hard green fruits which become yellow and soft upon maturity. These two species and S. ombrophilum of montane coastal Venezuela are unusual in the S. confine species group in having rather stout inflorescences and large flowers, but otherwise they conform to the characters of the rest of the species group, particularly in their seed and leaf morphology. Solanum pastillum blooms at the beginning of the wet season at Monteverde de Puntarenas, Costa Rica, the type locality, and is pollinated primarily by bumble bees, Bombus ephippiatus Say (Knapp, 1986a). The local distribution pattern of S. pastillum is typical of many of the forest understory species of section Geminata. Small clumps of three to five individuals grow at widely spaced intervals in the understory, often at the edges of old gaps caused by tree or branch falls. The inflorescences of S. pastillum are many-flowered, but only a few fruits per inflorescence develop. Whether this is due to poor pollination success or to fruit abortion is not known. The presence of a single fruit on a long inflorescence causes the effective pedicel length of the fruit to be extremely long. This may make the fruit more visible to small frugivorous bats, known to take the fruits of this and at least three other species of section Geminata in Monteverde (Dinerstein, 1983)."
wfo-0001022438,"Lycianthes maxonii var. maxonii is a relatively well-collected taxon in Panama, especially on Barro Colorado Island. Its combination of small size, delicate stems, obovate leaves with prominent drip-tip, pendulous flowers, deeply stellate corollas, connate anthers, and bright orange-red fruits with large seeds is distinctive. Its calyx features are quite variable, ranging from lacking appendages to having appendages to 2 mm long. It might be confused with Lycianthes heteroclita (Sendtn.) Bitter, with which it shares deeply stellate corollas and red fruits, however the orientation of the flowers and fruits differ. The flowers/fruits are pendulous on arching pedicles in L. maxonii and on erect pedicels in L. heteroclita.
Lycianthes maxonii var. maxonii differs from L. maxonii var. grandidentata D'Arcy in having: usually unifoliate sympodial units (with leaves not geminate) as opposed to difoliate upper sympodial units and a geminate leaf arrangement in var. grandidentata; narrower calyx appendages to 1 mm wide, as opposed to wider appendages to 1.5 mm wide (if they are present); purple corollas with white markings, rather than usually white corollas; pendulous fruits on narrow arching pedicels, rather than usually erect fruits on relatively stout pedicels; and ovoid fruits, rather than usually globose fruits. The seeds in var. grandidentata may be slightly larger and more rounded than those in var. maxonii. In addition, var. grandidentata may have a tendency to have more appendages (to 10) than var. maxonii (usually 5). The relationship between these two varieties needs to be studied, as the names should perhaps be synonymized or else var. grandidentata recognized at the specific level. Examination of important characters separating these two taxa is challenging using dried material.

wfo-0001025840,"Solanum alliariifolium is distinct within the morelloids in being a slender creeping herb rooting along nodes, with broadly ovate to orbicular leaves with crenate to shallowly lobed margins. It is morphologically most similar to S. leptocaulon, which occurs in similar montane habitats in Bolivia and in southern Peru, but the latter species is a small scrambling shrublet with entire-margined, ovate-lanceolate leaves. Solanum leptocaulon further differs from S. alliariifolium in having a campanulate corolla lobed only 1/3 of the way to the base, rather than a stellate corolla lobed to 2/3 to the base with the lobes clearly reflexed at anthesis."
wfo-0001027102,"Solanum clandestinum is unique in its narrowly elliptic to lanceolate and usually subcoriaceous leaves, inflorescences with very short peduncles and long pedicels, white corollas, oblong anthers, and conspicuous, orange, few-seeded fruits. It is apparently restricted to the Yungas of La Paz in northwestern Bolivia. Specimens can vary from being nearly glabrous to abundantly pubescent, especially on the young stems. The hairs are unbranched but can have wide multiseriate bases and in some specimens these give the twigs a roughened or corky aspect. Fruiting specimens of S. clandestinum can resemble S. confusum, another species of the Bolivian uplands. Solanum clandestinum is distinctive in its very short inflorescences, with the pedicels clustered and becoming long, slender, and curved in fruit. The seeds of S. clandestinum are not angled like those of S. confusum, and they always lack white pseudohairs on the surface. Flowers of S. clandestinum have white corollas and blunt, oblong anthers, whereas S. confusum flowers usually have violet corollas and tapered anthers. Solanum confusum lacks hairs with multiseriate bases."
wfo-0001022437,"Lycianthes maxonii var. grandidentata is a variety described by D'Arcy (1973 [1974]) from Santa Rita Ridge in Colon Province, Panama. This is still the main location of the known collections of this variety, although specimens that may belong to this variety have also been collected in adjacent Veraguas and Darien Provinces. This variety is very similar to Lycianthes maxonii var. maxonii and differs mainly in: often having difoliate upper sympodial units and a geminate leaf arrangement (usually unifoliate sympodial units and leaves not geminate in var. maxonii); having wider appendages on the calyx (to 1.5 mm wide), if they are present (rather than having narrower appendages [to 1 mm wide] in var. maxonii); usually having white corollas (rather than purple or white with purple markings in var. maxonii); usually having erect fruits on relatively stout pedicels (rather than usually having pendulous fruits on narrow arching pedicels in var. maxonii); and usually having globose fruits (rather than ovoid fruits in var. maxonii). Although the fruiting pedicels are usually erect, the buds and flowers are usually on curved pedicels that hold the flowers in a downward-pointing orientation. The seeds in var. grandidentata may be slightly larger and more rounded than those in var. maxonii. In addition, var. grandidentata may have a tendency to have more appendages (to 10) than var. maxonii (usually 5). The relationship between these two varieties needs to be studied, as the names should perhaps be synonymized or else var. grandidentata recognized at the specific level.

wfo-0001031876,"Solanum triplinervium is very similar to and perhaps most closely related to S. cyclophyllum of coastal Colombia and Ecuador and to S. unifoliatum of mainland Chocó department, Colombia, and differs from those species in its shorter inflorescences and in its striking leaf venation. The species all share unifoliate sympodia and rather large leaves. The leaf venation of S. triplinervium is unmistakeable, making this one of the easiest species in section Geminata to recognize. Solanum triplinervium has more pronounced parallel venation than S. cyclophyllum, but individual specimens can be difficult to identify. The calyx lobes of S. triplinervium are always minute, while those of S. cyclophyllum are deltate to long-triangular."
wfo-0001029333,"Solanum malletii can easily be distinguished from other members of the S. nutans species group by its orbicular minor leaves and auriculate major leaf bases. The elongate, densely pubescent inflorescences of this species are like those of S. youngii, but S. malletii is easily distinguished from that species by its non-bullate leaves, orbicular minor leaves, and low elevation habitat. The prescence of short-styled flowers in S. malletii (see Fig. 74B in Knapp, 2002) indicates that it is probably andromonoecious, but this has yet to be tested in the field."

Like those of S. havanense, the flowers become larger through anthesis. Solanum troyanum is very similar to S. havanense, but in addition to having larger flowers, is glabrous on all vegetative parts, including the very young growth. Solanum havanense occurs along the coastal fringe on limestone, while S. troyanum is a mountain plant, growing in moist forests on slopes. "
wfo-0001029048,"Solanum leptorhachis is most closely related to S. tenuiflagellatum of montane coastal Venezuela, sharing with that species extremely long inflorescences, flowers with the corolla lobes planar or only slightly reflexed at anthesis, and fruiting pedicels three to four times their length at anthesis and greatly expanded and corky at the apex. Plants collected at higher elevations (Boeke & Loyola 2179, Luteyn & Lebrón-Luteyn 6490, Zak 1113, 1283, 1285) have larger, apparently thicker leaves and larger flowers than more typical plants.This species it is a relatively common component of the understory, often growing in old light gaps and along small streams under closed canopy. In Tinalandia, near Santo Domingo, Ecuador, the leaves of S. leptorhachis are fed upon by the larvae of the ithomiine butterfly Pteronymia glauca (see Table XI of Knapp, 2002), and the plants are often severely defoliated by these caterpillars.  The specimen collected in Tumbes, Peru (Simpson & Schunke V. 429) consists of a few apparently virally infected sucker shoots with very small, deformed leaves and very short inflorescences."
wfo-0001027843,"Solanum erosomarginatum is closely related to S. dissimile, also of Andean Venezuela, but differs from that species in its larger, darker green leaves with conspicuously erose margins, smaller stature, difoliate, geminate sympodia, longer inflorescences, and larger flowers. Leaf size in S. erosomarginatum varies considerably, but the consistent presence of minor leaves is enough to distinguish this species from any other closely related to it. Solanum erosomarginatum is a delicate shrub of forest understory and although rare distributionally, is rather common where it does occur."
wfo-0001029120,"Solanum longevirgatum is unusual in the S. unifoliatum species group in possessing copious golden trichomes on the young stems and leaves. It is otherwise most similar to S. unifoliatum of lowland Chocó department, sharing with that species elongate inflorescences and often erose leaf margins. A recnet collection from Nariño has small minor leaves, making the sympodial units difoliate and geminate; this species may be polymorphic for this trait."
wfo-0001025907,"Solanum anceps is one of the most widespread and variable of the species of section Pteroidea. It is basically an Amazonian lowland species, but is found in the Andes of Peru and Bolivia up to elevations of about 2000 m. There is little discernible difference between the high and low elevation forms, as so often occurs in other groups of Solanum (Knapp, 2002). Considerable geographical variation in pubescence exists within S. anceps, with some densely hairy populations being found throughout the species range. New leaves are always more densely pubescent than mature leaves and there may be a developmental or genetic component to pubescence in S. anceps. Leaf size also varies a great deal in S. anceps, with some leaves attaining very large sizes in shady habitats. Purple leaf undersides are common in S. anceps and are noted on many herbarium labels. Unlike in S. savanillense, the purple color of the leaves is not also found in the flowers (see discussion of S. savanillense). Plants with purple and green leaves have been seen growing side by side, so perhaps there is a genetic rather than environmental cause for this character. In lowland Peru (departments of Loreto and Ucayali), a series of specimens appear quite distinct. These sheets (given a manuscript name honouring A.C. Smith by C.V. Morton) have longer petioles, more truncate leaf bases, and somewhat more pointed fruits, but a series of well-marked intermediates occur and we thus prefer to retain this variant within S. anceps. Some specimens from Bolivia have more strongly decurrent leaf bases than those from further north, but again, a wide range of intermediates exist. The degree to which these forms are reproductively isolated and may be in the process of speciation of differentiation is worth further study. Other characters, such as DNA sequences or leaf chemistry, may differ or concur with the morphological ones observed here."
wfo-0001030083,"Solanum ombrophilum is similar and closely related to S. pastillum of montane Costa Rica, but differs from it in its unifoliate nodes, deltoid calyx lobes, and more closely packed pedicel scars. The flowers of S. ombrophilum vary considerably in size depending on their sex, with male (short-styled) flowers being much smaller and with shorter anthers than hermaphroditic flowers. Flowers of both types can be borne on the same plant, and flowers with intermediate style lengths occasionally occur. A given individual however, is most often either short-styled or long-styled. Solanum ombrophilum is quite common where it occurs, and at the type locality is an important component of the forest understory."
wfo-0001031064,"Solanum savanillense is superficially similar to many of the other pinnate-leaved members of section Pteroidea. It can be distinguished easily, however, by its larger flowers, more elliptic, slightly less rugose fruits and its tall stature. This last character is impossible to ascertain from herbarium sheets, but in the field S. savanillense is quite distinct from S. mite or S. conicum, the only other members of the group to attain such sizes. The leaves of S. savanillense are more pubescent adaxially than abaxially, the reverse of the pattern in other members of the group. In 5-foliolate leaves of S. savanillense, the basal pair of leaflets is conspicuously smaller than the other pair, a characteristic not found in other species in the section. In Parque Nacional Podocarpus in southern Ecuador Solanum savanillense is polymorphic for both flower and stem colour but the leaves are uniformly green, never tinged with purple as occurs in polymorphic populations of S. anceps (for example). In populations collected ascending the Nudo de Cajanuma, groups of plants were either green-stemmed and white-flowered or with purple nodes and purple-flowered. This polymorphism may be purely genetic in origin. Solanum savanillense grows in understory in deep shade, and plants of both colour morphs were found side by side, indicating little ecological control of this character. "
wfo-0001032531,"Solanum woodburyi is known from only a few collections in the Bosque Nacional del Caribe in the Luquillo Mountains. It is a distinctive species, with its wand-like habit and strongly discolorous leaves. The leaves are morphologically similar to those of S. crotonoides and S. dendroicum in being almost glabrous above and densely pubescent beneath, but the long-stalked echinoid trichomes of S. woodburyi are distinctive. Solanum crotonoides and possibly S. dendroicum are dioecious; the breeding system of S. woodburyi is not known, but I suspect from the morphology of the few extant specimens that it too is dioecious. "
wfo-0001028115,"Solanum gilioides is broadly sympatric with S. weddellii, also of high elevations, but that species tends to occur in sandy, rather than rocky habitats. The two species both have strongly inflated calyces in fruit, but those of S. gilioides are larger and the lobes have acute to acuminate tips. The calyx lobes of S. gilioides are fused, like those of most species of Physalis while in S. weddellii the lobes remain free but overlapping."
wfo-0001026963,"Solanum chamaeacanthum has an unusual habit in Solanum, that of a creeping subshrub rooting at the nodes. The creeping habit appears to have arisen several times in the genus, in both the spiny and non-spiny solanums. In the Leptostemonum clade, several Australian species (e.g. S. serpens, S. acanthodapis), the Brazilian S. reineckii and a recently described Bolivian species (S. moxosense) also are creeping and rooting at the nodes. These species are not closely related (see Levin et al., 2006; Weese & Bohs, 2007). Leaf pubescence is very variable in Solanum chamaeacanthum; the lectotype specimen at K has two stems, one of which is pubescent and the other completely glabrous. Solanum chamaeacanthum is most similar to several other endemic Caribbean species that also have very prickly leaves and nearly glabrous vegetative parts such as S. gundlachii, S. schulzianum and S. selleanum. It is easily distinguished from those taxa by its creeping habit, smaller leaves and elongate inflorescences with only a few flowers at the extreme tips."
wfo-0001026268,"Solanum apiahyense, described more than a century ago (Witasek 1910), has not been assigned to any infraspecific group of Solanum so far. Recent phylogenetic analysis using molecular data (Giacomin 2015) has shown it to be closely related to S. trachytrichium, which was previously assigned to the Geminata clade (Knapp 2002, 2008) and to its own subsection when originaly described (subsect. Silicosolanum Bitter; Bitter 1919). Bitter (1919) based this on the unusual trichome morphology of hooked cells arising from a flattened multicellular base that give the leaves a feeling of sandpaper in herbarium specimens. Although molecular data support a close relationship between S. apiahyense and S. trachytrichium, the affinities of this clade are not clear-cut. Data from combined markers place it as sister to all other Geminata clade species, but with low support. In analyses of individual markers, it emerges as sister to either the Brevantherum or Geminata clades depending upon the marker used (Giacomin 2015). Morphologically both taxa are easy to distinguish from most other Geminata species, and have the following assemblage of characters: both are small shrubs with leaves mostly not geminate, they have leaf trichomes with an expanded multicellular base and relatively large flowers (>1.5 cm in diameter). Among them, Solanum apiahyense and S. trachytrichium are easy to distinguish: S. trachytrichium has a unique scabrous indumentum on the leaf surfaces and stems, composed of short unicellular hooked trichomes on a mound-like multicellular base, while in S. apiahyense the surface is not rough to the touch, and although some trichomes with multicellular bases can be seen on leaves, these are translucent, very long (about 2 mm) and mostly 5-7-celled. These long trichomes of S. apiahyense are easily seen on the new growth, while S. trachytrichium trichomes are not visible to the naked eye. In addition, the flowers of S. apiahyense are slightly smaller, 1.5-1.7 cm in diameter versus 1.6-2.2 cm in S. trachytrichium. In the past, the epithet S. apiahyense has been applied to more than one species of the S. inornatum group (part of the Brevantherum clade; Giacomin and Stehmann 2014) by various Solanum taxonomists, although they are now known to not be closely related. Although members of the S. inornatum group (e.g., S. inornatum Witasek, S. bradei Giacomin & Stehmann and relatives) and S. apiahyense are similar in habit and in having pubescence of long, translucent trichomes, they can be readily distinguished by close examination of the trichomes; those of S. apiahyense are multicellular with 5-7(8) cells while those of members of the S. inornatum group are mostly 3-celled (probably representing modified stellate hairs, Giacomin and Stehmann 2014). Fruiting specimens of S. apiahyense have peduncles longer than 1 cm and the pedicels are strongly apically expanded and constricted just beneath the calyx lobes (see Figure 1C in Knapp et al. 2015), while in the species of the S. inornatum group species, the peduncles do not exceed 1 cm and the pedicels are never apically expanded with a distal constriction. Examination of trichomes with a 10x hand lens will allow easy identification of both flowering and fruiting material.
"
wfo-0001027536,"Solanum diamantinense is similar to S. rhytidoandrum Sendtn., S. decorum and S. apiculatum. They share elliptic and discolorous leaves, 2- to 3-branched inflorescences, white, stellate corollas, brown to dark brown fruits at maturity, and large lenticular seeds. However, Solanum diamantinense can be distinguished from S. rhytidoandrum by the following characters: inflorescence with fewer flowers; very short calyx lobes (close to 1 mm); and the upper surface of the leaves velutinous to tomentose with glandular-stellate hairs with multiseriate stalks. In S. rhytidoandrum the inflorescences have up to 30 flowers; the calyx lobes are parted 3/4 of the way to the base, and the stellate hairs of the upper surface of leaves are sessile and uniseriate with long, 2-3-celled midpoints. Solanum diamantinense is also similar to S. decorum and S. apiculatum but can be distinguished from them by its longer corolla, very short calyx lobes, and by the glandular-stellate multiseriate and stalked trichomes present on all parts of the plant, particularly on the leaves, and its restricted geographical range. Solanum decorum and S. apiculatum have attenuate leaves and the stellate hairs on the upper surface of the leaf blades are sessile. In S. decorum the indument of the branches, petioles and principal venation of the blade leaves is reddish, and the trichomes have reduced midpoints. Solanum apiculatum is a scandent shrub with ferruginous indument with sessile stellate hairs with 1- to many-celled midpoints."
wfo-0001026964,"Solanum chamaepolybotryon is the most diminutive species of the S. mite species group and apparently only grows as a small, fleshy herb in middle elevation cloud forest in NE Peru. It has only been collected a few times, but is apparently clonal and grows in large groups (Knapp & Mallet 6590). This species also occurs in the Maynesian Andes of Spruce (Spruce, 1908, see discussion under S. angustialatum) and may be derived from the more widespread S. conicum."
wfo-0001030869,"Solanum riojense is phylogenetically and morphologically closely related to S. echegarayi and S. sinuatirecurvum. It differs from S. echegarayi in the tangled, floccose pubescence of new growth (versus uniform, short erect, trichomes or absence of pubescence in S. echegarayi) and the calyx lobes with rounded rather than sharply acute tips. Solanum riojense is similar to S. sinuatirecurvum in the floccose pubescence of new growth, but differs in having smaller flowers (1.8–2 cm in diameter versus 2–2.6 cm in diameter in S. sinuatirecurvum) and berries (0.8–1.1 cm in diameter versus 1–1.3 cm in diameter in S. sinuatirecurvum). The rounded calyx lobe apices of S. riojense in both flower and fruit differentiate it from S. sinuatirecurvum (with sharply pointed calyx lobe tips). Mature fruit colour of S. riojense is not known."
wfo-0001028436,"Solanum hoffmanseggii, although rarely collected, is morphologically and geographically distinct from the other species of section Gonatotrichum. This species is more robust than any of the other species except S. lignescens, which can be easily distinguished by its stellate hairs. Anomalously large plants of S. turneroides may reach nearly similar sizes; however, S. turneroides has much larger fruits and heterantherous flowers. The most similar species is S. olympicum, which occurs in southernmost Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina. The two species share distinct geniculate hairs as well as seeds with raised ridges radiating from the center to the margins. Unlike S. hoffmanseggii, S. olympicum has much broader, larger leaves and is a more diminutive plant. Solanum hoffmanseggii is the only member of section Gonatotrichum known from northern Brazil. The Souza et al. 263 collection is unusual because the leaves are more ovate than other specimens of S. hoffmanseggii but other characteristics and its geographic location are consistent with this species. The nearest members of the section geographically are S. evolvuloides and S. olympicum, which are found in the drier northeastern state of Bahia and in deciduous forest of northern Goiás respectively.

wfo-0001030441,"In the treatment of Solanum for Flora of China (Zhang et al. 1994) many of the names here treated as synonyms of S. pittosporifolium were recognised at the specific level and considered to be doubtfully distinct from Solanum dulcamara.The two species can be very difficult to distinguish when in fruit, but S. pittosporifolium has shorter and sparser pubescence than does S. dulcamara, and is usually a more delicate plant. The leaves of S. pittosporifolium are never divided, and usually have undulate margins; those of S. dulcamara are more variable, but usually have more acute bases than those of S. pittosporifolium. In flower, the two are easily separated - S. pittosporifolium as elliptic anthers that are not held tightly together and the buds are ovoid or ellipsoid, never turbinate like those of S. dulcamara. The leaf pubescence of S. septemlobum is similar to that of S. pittosporifolium, but the two species can be distinguished by flower size (those of S. septemlobum are larger and the petals are usually not reflexed) and by the shorter, stiffer trichomes of S. pittosporifolium. In general, S. pittosporifolium is a more tropical plant than is S. septemlobum, although they do overlap in central China. When S. pittosporifolium grows along roadsides and is cut back regularly it appears to be a shrub, but if left to extend its branches it becomes a flexuous vine. I have collected it growing in river courses where it seems to be behaving as a rheophyte, but populations outside of this sort of habitat have identical almost glabrous, narrow leaves.
"
wfo-0001029744,"Solanum naucinum is a member of the Solanum dolosum species group (sensu Knapp, 2002a), with unifoliate sympodia on reproductive nodes, filamentous inflorescences and long-acuminate leaves with ciliate margins near the apex. It differs from all other species in the group in its distinctive golden dendritic pubescence. Like the other taxa in the S. dolosum species group (Knapp, 2002a), S. naucinum is apparently a rare plant. Solanum naucinum shares with S. gonyrhachis an elongate inflorescence with widely spaced pedicel scars. In Knapp’s key to the S. dolosum species group an additional couplet could be added: plants with dendritic pubescence (S. naucinum) vs. plants with simple uniseriate pubescence or glabrous (S. dolosum C.V. Morton of Colombia and Ecuador, S. gonyrhachis S. Knapp of Bolivia, S. habrocaulon S. Knapp of northern Peru). Characters from the synoptic key useful for differentiating S. naucinum are: unifoliate sympodia; dendritic trichomes; pagoda-like architecture (sensu Knapp, 2002a); and a filiform inflorescence. Like its close relatives, Solanum naucinum is a spindly shrub, possibly also growing as a hemiepiphyte in its cloud forest habitat. Seeds in the fruits on the type specimen are immature, but appear to be ovoid-reniform without incrassate margins, however, mature fruits and flowers are needed to complete the morphological description of this rare species. Although this material is limited for the description of a new taxon, no new collections of this rare species have come to light in the past 20 years. The type of Solanum naucinum was collected within or very near to what was designated the Parque Nacional Yanachaga-Chemillén in 1986, a relatively undisturbed region in the Upper Pachitea River drainage of the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes. Edaphic diversity in the park may account for its high floristic diversity (R.B. Foster cited in Young et al., 1997), it sits on the transition zone between two major geological areas of the Andes. The Parque Nacional Yanachaga-Chemillén is very inaccessible, perhaps affording it some protection from large-scale coca cultivation, the principal cause of habitat destruction in this center of plant diversity (Henkel, 1995; Young et al., 1997), although such areas both outside and within the park are threatened due in part to this inaccessibility. "
wfo-0001028390,"This species is most similar to S. luteoalbum of Peru and S. stuckertii of south-central Bolivia and Argentina. Solanum hibernum is distinctive in having strongly discolorous leaf surfaces with the lower surface densely covered with dendritically branched hairs. Many specimens of S. luteoalbum also have dendritically branched pubescence, but the hairs are more evenly distributed on both leaf surfaces. Solanum hibernum and S. luteoalbum are geographically disjunct, and no hybrids resulted from greenhouse crossing attempts (Bohs, 2001). In general, S. hibernum can be distinguished from S. stuckertii by hair morphology and corolla color. Solanum stuckertii invariably has unbranched hairs and whitish corollas. All specimens of S. hibernum have dendritically branched hairs (at least on the abaxial leaf surfaces) and most have purplish corollas. However, in Nee 46524 the collector described the corollas as being white with a yellow central vein. Polymorphism for blue and white flowers, even within a single population, has been noted in species of Solanum sections Petota and Solanum (Correll, 1962; Henderson, 1974; Edmonds, 1977), but the frequency of white corollas in S. hibernum needs further investigation. Furthermore, hybrids have been produced between S. hibernum and S. stuckertii in greenhouse crosses. The F1 hybrid plants resembled S. hibernum in pubescence characters, but had whitish or very light lavender corolla lobes with a yellowish central star. Many individuals of S. hibernum become leafless during the dry season, but remain conspicuous because of their persistent bright orange fruits that hang like tiny Halloween pumpkins from the bare branches (M. Nee, pers. obs.)."
wfo-0001026827,"Solanum canoasense is distinctive among southeastern Brazilian members of the Geminata clade in its large flowers and floccose, but soon glabrescent, new growth. The species is known from very few collections, it is apparently very rare. Mentz & Oliveira (2004) put S. canoasense in synonymy with S. cassioides L.B. Smith & Downs, from which it differs in not possessing the distinctive broad-based trichomes found in S. cassioides and its relative S. trachytrichium Bitter, and in its plurifoliate, rather than difoliate, sympodial units. Solanum canoasense is probably a member of the S. nigricans species group (sensu Knapp, 2002) based on the possession of floccose trichomes on the new growth, but seed morphology is not known. The type of S. canoasense is nearly glabrous, like S. bahianum S. Knapp of coastal Bahia, Brazil. Solanum canoasense differs from S. bahianum in its plurifoliate rather than unifoliate sympodia, and in its larger flowers that are somewhat campanulate at anthesis. The two species occupy very different habitats, S. bahianum the coastal restingas and S. canoasense upland Araucaria forests. No fruiting specimens are known, and collections of fruiting material are a priority. "
wfo-0001031834,"Solanum trachytrichium is clearly closely related to S. cassioides, also of southeastern Brazil. S. trachytrichium is easily distinguished from that species by its larger, campanulate flowers, shorter inflorescences, and scabrous leaves. The scabrous leaf surfaces make this one of the easiest species in section Geminata to identify using vegetative characters. The trichomes are unusual in the section in having a unicellular hook on a mound-like multicellular base. In dry material, the entire trichome is transparent, and the bases appear as white specks on the upper leaf surfaces. Their structure was so different to that of other solanum trichomes that Bitter described subsection Silicosolanum, containing only S. trachytrichium. The trichomes do not contain silica, but are rough to the touch, thus the name. "
wfo-0001028798,"Solanum julocrotonoides is distinguished from other members of section Brevantherum by its oblanceolate leaves that are boat-shaped and curved, yellowish pubescence, large flower buds, and pale yellow corollas.  This very distinct species shows no outstanding relationship to any particular member of section Brevantherum. Solanum granuloso-leprosum (also of Paraguay and SE Brazil) and S. stipulaceum (of NE Brazil) are perhaps its nearest relatives; they inhabit similar dry habitats. Solanum julocrotonoides can be distinguished from those two similar species by its concolorous leaves, shorter inflorescence axes and yellow flowers. "
wfo-0001029621,"Solanum monadelphum is closely related to S. sessile (Knapp, 1991b), also of eastern Peru, but is easily distinguished from that species by its narrow, willow-like leaves, plurifoliate sympodial units, and riverbed habitat. The buds of the two species are nearly identical, and the inflorescence structure is quite similar. In the area around Quincemil (Peru, Cuzco, Quispicanchis), intermediates between the local form of S. sessile and S. monadelphum are common. The intermediates are usually found growing in the water with typical S. monadelphum plants. This could represent local variation in S. monadelphum or hybridization between the two species. Solanum monadelphum and S. sessile are sympatric in other parts of their ranges, but I have seen intermediates only in the Quincemil area. Solanum monadelphum is one of the most ecologically striking members of section Geminata. It is a shrub of river beds, growing on gravel or sand banks, and is subject to periodic inundation, particularily in the wet season, when the plants may spend many days underwater. The narrow leaves of S. monadelphum are related to this habitat. Three other species also growing in river beds, but not necessarily closely related to S. monadelphum (S. palmillae, S. imberbe of the S. deflexiflorum species group, S. amnicola of the S. arboreum species group), share this leaf shape. Solanum monadelphum is common where it occurs, forming dense knee-high thickets along riverbanks in local areas."
wfo-0001022238,"Lycianthes biflora is a name that has been widely used for shrubby Lycianthes in tropical Asia. Lycianthes biflora is very similar to L. schizocalyx, which also has 10 linear to subulate calyx appendages. The appendages in L. biflora are all the same length in a single flower and arise from the edge of the calyx tube, leaving no hyaline rim above their emergence. The appendages of L. schizocalyx, in contrast are usually of variable length in a flower and at least some of them arise from below the edge of the tube, leaving a hyaline rim. The calyx appendages in L. biflora vary in length in individual plants and populations across the range; plants from northern India with longer calyx appendages have been called L. macrodon. The flowering pedicels of L. biflora are 0.9–1.2 cm long, whereas those of L. schizocalyx are (1)2–3 cm long; individual specimens can sometimes be difficult to distinguish using this single character. It may also be that the species hybridise where they co-occur (i.e., places like Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia). Lycianthes shunningensis is also a shrubby species with 10 calyx appendages, but these arise from well below the edge of the calyx tube and are distinctly turned downwards, especially in fruit. Lycianthes biflora collections made from young plants can be difficult to distinguish from L. lysimachioides, but that species is a creeping or scandent herb, has a single flower per fascicle (only rarely more) and larger flowers (corolla 1.8–3 cm versus 1.4–1.8 cm in diameter in L. biflora)."
wfo-0001028686,"Solanum interandinum is one of the commonest species of morelloids in the northern Andes and is called hierba mora (black nightshade) throughout its range. It is highly variable, as are most widespread morelloid species (see discussion of synonymy below); plants with the flowers clustered at the tips of the inflorescence branches have been called S. interandinum whereas those with the flowers more spaced along the inflorescence axes have been called S. zahlbruckneri. Solanum interandinum is a small shrub where the old, forked inflorescences remain on the plant long after the fruits have fallen (along with their pedicels). The leaf margins are usually entire and only rarely with some shallow lobing near the base and leaf size is highly variable within and between individual plants. It is morphologically similar to S. nigrescens in northern Colombia and Venezuela, S. cochabambense in Peru and S. gonocladum in Peru and Bolivia. Solanum nigrescens is a more herbaceous plant, with an unbranched (very occasionally forked) inflorescence that is not woody and persistent after fruit fall. Anthers of S. interandinum are longer (2.5–3 mm long on filaments 0.5–1 mm long versus 2–2.8 mm long on filaments 0.5–2 mm long) relative to the filaments than those of S. nigrescens, and the calyx lobes are more than 1 mm long and long-triangular rather than less than 1 mm long and deltate to broadly deltate in S. nigrescens. Solanum cochabambense is a much larger plant, with more branched (rather than always forked) inflorescences and larger flowers (2–3 cm in diameter with anthers 3.5–4.5 mm long versus 1–1.2 cm in diameter with anthers 2–3 mm long in S. interandinum). In central Peru it can be very difficult to tell these two species apart with single herbarium specimens, and it is possible they hybridise. In northern Bolivia and southern Peru S. interandinum is somewhat confusable with S. gonocladum, but that species has larger flowers (1.3–2 cm in diameter with anthers 4–4.5 mm long versus 1–1.2 cm in diameter with anthers 2–3 mm long in S. interandinum) and spathulate (rather than apically pointed) calyx lobes. Both these species have calyx lobes that dry dark in herbarium specimens."
wfo-0001028208,"Solanum grandidentatum was long known as S. excisirhombeum, but Philippi’s name has priority as the oldest name for this species. This shrubby Andean species is morphologically very similar to S. fragile but differs in its shrubby habit (S. fragile has a woody underground rootstock, and specimens often consist of the brittle, herbaceous stems only), its distinct somewhat musty odour when fresh, and narrower, lanceolate calyx lobes. Both taxa are densely glandular pubescent and lack stone cells in the fruit. Calyx lobes of S. grandidentatum are 1–1.5 mm long with acuminate or acute tips, while those of S. fragile are 2–3 mm long with blunt tips; leaves can also be useful in distinguishing the two taxa, those of S. grandidentatum are more attenuate at the base. "
wfo-0001027607,"Solanum dissimile is most closely related to S. erosomarginatum, also of Andean Venezuela. It differs from that species in its usually unifoliate sympodia, more congested inflorescences, smaller flowers, less pubescent foliage, and non-erose leaf margins. Individuals of S. dissimile grow to be small trees along streams in the cloud forest, and are among the largest members of the S. confine species group. Solanum dissimile, like other members of the group, grows in closed or partially closed canopy forest. Solanum dissimile is quite common where it occurs, and is a major component of the forest understory."
wfo-0001028181,"Solanum gonocladum is an upright shrubby plant often with scrambling stems that are extremely woody at the base. The flowers are large in comparison to other South American morelloid species (to 2 cm in diameter, with anthers to 5 mm long) and the darkened spathulate calyx lobes that hug the base of the berry are diagnostic. It is usually a species of puna regions at high elevation, although Eyerdam 24741 (F, K) was collected at 1,500 m elevation. Solanum gonocladum is somewhat similar morphologically to S. interandinum, with which it shares spathulate calyx lobes and strongly deflexed fruiting pedicels but differs from it in its slightly larger flowers (1.6–2 cm in diameter versus 0.8–1.4 cm in diameter, with anthers 3–5 mm long versus 2.5–3 mm long), and larger berries (0.8–1 cm in diameter versus 0.6–0.8 cm in diameter). In both species the inflorescence often remains on older stems after flowers and fruits have fallen. "
wfo-0001031586,"In the monograph of Solanum section Geminata (Knapp, 2002) the Peruvian collections Peyton & Peyton 147, 1026 & 1026b and Ferreyra 16683 were included in the delimitation of Solanum daphnophyllum Bitter, a similarly glabrous species from Bolivia, but with some reservations. Solanum daphnophyllum is a species of middle to high elevation (700-2800 m) dry to semi-humid forests on the eastern Andean slopes from central Bolivia to the Department of Puno in Peru (Ferreyra 16683), while S. sumacaspi is apparently only found in disturbed forests in much higher elevations (2100-3500 m) in grassland (puna)/forest transition areas in the Urubamba River drainage. Morphologically S. sumacaspi differs from S. daphnophyllum in its more elongate inflorescences with more widely spaced pedicel scars and in its pale green, exfoliating bark; S. daphnophyllum has inflorescences usually only ca. 1 cm long, and dark reddish shiny bark on all stems. The apparently geminate sympodial units also differentiate S. sumacaspi from S. daphnophyllum, which has difoliate, but not geminate, units. Solanum sumacaspi resembles members of the Solanum nudum species group (sensu Knapp, 2002), and would key out in the first set of couplets in Knapp’s key, either with S. restingae S. Knapp and S. warmingii Hiern (both of southeastern Brazil) or with S. daphnophyllum Bitter and S. cordioides S. Knapp. Solanum sumacaspi differs from the first two in its unwinged stems and deltate calyx lobes and from the second pair by the characters detailed above with discussion of S. daphnophyllum. Solanum cordioides, an endemic species of southeastern Brazil, has a highly branched inflorescence with tiny greenish white flowers and could not be confused with S. sumacaspi. Solanum sumacaspi also morphologically resembles two species in the Solanum arboreum species group (sensu Knapp, 2002) in its showy inflorescences of flowers all apparently opening at once; S. gratum Bitter of the Cordillera de la Costa in Venezuela and S. plowmanii S. Knapp of the western Andean slopes in Peru and Ecuador. The shiny stems also are similar to S. goniocaulon S. Knapp of the eastern Andean slopes of northern Peru and southern Ecuador, also of the S. arboreum species group. It can be differentiated from all those species by the combination of its yellowish exfoliating bark, shiny leaves that dry a very pale green, its non-anisophyllous leaves and its high elevation southern Peruvian distribution. The following suite of characters from the synoptic key in Knapp (2002a: 42-43) will differentiate S. sumacaspi: bark of older stems exfoliating; plants completely glabrous; and possibly calyx lobes orbicular (live plants; otherwise only known in the Costa Rican species S. pastillum S. Knapp). The distribution and high elevation habitat of S. sumacaspi would further differentiate it from other superficially similar species. Since Solanum sumacaspi appears to be relatively common in the Cusco area, fruiting collections are a priority in order to assign it to a species group with confidence. DNA sequence studies underway on a genus-wide scale in Solanum (Bohs, 2005) will certainly, however, lead to reassessment of these informal species groups based only on overall morphology. Solanum sumacaspi occurs in the ecotone between the Peruvian puna (Young et al., 1997) and eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes centers of plant diversity. These habitats in southern Peru are generally drier than similar grassland to forest transistion zones further to the north, and often experience a marked dry season (Young et al., 1997). Specimens of S. sumacaspi have been collected in or near the Santuario Histórico Macchu Picchu, an area with some protection from human intervention, although pressure on forests of these types from overgrazing can be severe (Kok et al., 1995; Young et al., 1997). However, most specimens appear to come from secondary or disturbed forest and forest edges, indicating either that this species is a colonizer or that the forest is highly disturbed and impacted. The conservation status of S. sumacaspi has not been formally evaluated, as no information as to population size is included on labels, but it is likely to be not at immediate threat, based on its recent collection and its apparently second growth habitat."
wfo-0001028280,"Solanum habrocaulon is distinguished from the other members of the S. dolosum species group by its completely glabrous foliage, strongly winged stems and minute inflorescences. Members of this group are all apparently rare, but since they are very inconspicuous plants it is extremely likely that they are merely undercollected."
wfo-0001032564,"Solanum yanamonense is similar and probably closely related to S. confine, also of Amazonian Peru, but the latter species is found in the foothills of the Andes and not in the true Amazonian lowlands. Solanum yanamonense differs from S. confine in its smaller stature, distinctive leaf venation with the main lateral veins arching and converging again very near the midrib, and in its minute, greenish flowers. The leaf apex of S. yanamonense differs from that of all closely related species in being long-acuminate with a truncate tip. Solanum yanamonense is a small understory shrub of terra firme primary forest and is grows abundantly in clumps where it occurs. Its range may be much more extensive, but because of its small, inconspicuous green flowers and fruit, it is not likely to be collected often; however it should be looked for in Amazonian Brazil. "
wfo-0001030583,"Solanum pseudocapsicum is a widespread and extremely variable species. Cultivated forms that are generally completely glabrous have been traditionally known as S. pseudocapsicum, while native plants have gone by a variety of names. Degree of pubescence, however, is a continuous gradient throughout the native and introduced range of the species and is not a reliable character with which to differentiate taxa in this group. Many of the numerous synonyms of Solanum pseudocapsicum are well-marked geographical variants that taken alone without consideration across the entire species range are distinct. The following are the more clearly marked of these variations. 1) Cultivated specimens are almost always completely glabrous (occasionally with a few dendritic trichomes on the new growth) and they often have large flowers and fruit. Some apparently native collections from Uruguay, near Buenos Aires, Argentina and near São Paulo, Brazil are of this general morphology. The type of Solanum pseudocapsicum was a cultivated plant collected in Madeira (see Knapp & Jarvis, 1991). 2) Plants with broadly elliptic leaves and small fruits from the province of Tucumán, Argentina have been called Solanum tucumanense.  3) Populations with very dense pubescence from high elevation Bolivia have been called Solanum validum.  4) In the dry coastal valleys of Venezuela and Colombia plants with small flowers, small fruit, and narrow leaves have been called Solanum karstenii.  5) Plants with the most common morphology, found in southern Mexico and southern Brazil, have been called Solanum diflorum. Other named populations are merely extremes from this mean."
wfo-0001026215,"Solanum angustialatum is only known from the area above Tarapoto (Departmento of San Martin, Peru) in wet premontane forest. It is sympatric with S. anceps and is perhaps derived from that species. The eastern slopes of the Andes are an area of extremely high diversity, with many species of local distribution. The type of S. angustialatum was collected by Spruce in what he termed the Maynesian Andes (Spruce, 1908), an isolated chain running between approximately Pucallpa (Departmento Ucayali) and Bagua on the Río Marañon (Departmento Amazonas). Many of the plants collected by Spruce were known only from their types until collecting in the 1980s added substantially to these holdings. Further collecting in other parts of this small but quite distinct mountain range may reveal range extensions for many of these apparently narrow endemics. The broadly winged stem of Solanum angustialatum is sometimes difficult to see in herbarium specimens, but the strongly decurrent leaves are quite distinctive and unlike those occurring in S. anceps."
wfo-0001029593,"Solanum mite is the most common of the species of section Pteroidea, forming large thickets in treefall gaps in the primary and secondary forest and along streams and roads in partial shade. Like S. anceps, it is basically an Amazonian species, but unlike S. anceps, S. mite occurs only in the southern part of the Amazon basin, not extending far north of the N bank of the Rio Amazonas. Solanum mite is superficially similar to both S. conicum and S. uleanum, but can be differentiated easily from those species by its rounded fruit, pendant at maturity. Solanum mite can be hard to distinguish from S. conicum in flower, but the latter usually has larger flowers with the petals held planar at anthesis, while S. mite has tiny ones with strongly reflexed petals. Other differences from S. conicum are discussed with that species. Numbers of leaflets and size of leaves are extremely variable in S. mite, but leaflet shape is consistently obovate, with the terminal leaflet usually much larger and more enlarged in the distal third. The type specimen of S. pteleifolium (Martius s.n.) has ternate leaves with large, broad leaflets, There exist however a range of intermediates in both leaflet size and number: Maas et al P12838 from Acre, Brazil and Plowman et al. 6401 from near Leticia on the Colombia/Peru border approach Martius’s collection in their broader leaflets, but given the range of variability in S. mite, we prefer to take a broad concept of the species. Many of the minor variants have been described as separate species by Bitter, but the range of variation in S. mite as recognized here encompasses all of these. Huge variability in leaf pubescence of collections made in the department of San Martín, Peru by Knapp in 1986, shows that pubescence density and occurrence are both quite variable within populations of S. mite. In this series of collections, made near Tarapoto, no differences in phenology or other ecological characteristics were observed, and no morphological differences other than pubescence were seen. The nature of inheritance of this character is not known, but is likely to be relatively simple. "
wfo-0001027594,"Solanum diphyllum is most similar to S. malacothrix, a rare species from western Mexico. The two species share small flowers with reflexed petals at anthesis and berries borne on erect pedicels. Solanum diphyllum differs from S. malacothrix in its glabrous foliage. The mature fruit of S. malacothrix is not known (see discussion under that species). Solanum diphyllum is native to Mexico and Central America, where it is widespread in drier habitats. It has been widely cultivated as a foliage shrub, and for its pretty flowers and brightly colored fruits, in tropical and subtropical areas where it is hardy such as Italy, southern France, and Florida (D'Arcy, 1974), the Antilles, Java, and the Philippines, and has escaped in some of these areas. Solanum diphyllum is an attractive shrub, with its tiny white-purple flowers and bright orange fruits. It is self-compatible, but not autogamous. All the flowers are long-styled and the plants set abundant fruit when exposed to pollinators. In cultivation the plants are bushy, with many leaves. In their native Mexico however, shrubs of S. diphyllum are often quite straggly (Nee, pers. comm.). In Mexico and Central America Solanum diphyllum is remarkably uniform morphologically and is usually easily recognizable. A single geographical variant occurs in Pacific coastal Chiapas. In the municipalities of Arriaga and Cintalapa, near the Mar Muerto on the Pacific coast and somewhat inland, plants of a narrow-leaved race of S. diphyllum are common. Plants from this area have leaves that average 1 cm wide, but otherwise they conform to the other characters of S. diphyllum. Naming this minor variant would obscure its relationship to the rest of the species range. "
wfo-0001031672,"Solanum tegore belongs to the S. circinatum clade and manifests some of the typical characters of the group: pinnately lobed trunk leaves, greenish stellate corollas with narrow lobes, long narrow anthers, and slender cylindrical styles with small truncate stigmas. Its abundant pubescence, unbranched inflorescences, ciliate corolla margins, and pubescent fruits closely resemble those of S. cacosmum, but S. tegore differs in having lobed rather than entire trunk leaves and fruits with obtuse rather than acute apices. Molecular data indicate that these two species are not closely related. "
wfo-0001027600,"Solanum diploconos can be distinguished from other southeastern Brazilian species of Solanum section Pachyphylla by its very broadly expanded and nearly glabrous stigma and style, usually glabrous foliage, and globose fruits without stone cell aggregates. Its fleshy campanulate corolla, broad and curved stamens with the connective abruptly narrowed above the base, expanded style and stigma, and puberulent fruits indicate a close relationship with the Brazilian species S. sciadostylis, S. latiflorum, and S. premnifolium. ITS sequence data also support a close relationship among S. diploconos, S. sciadostylis, and S. latiflorum; molecular data are not available for S. premnifolium. Normally the corolla of S. diploconos is a very deep purple upon anthesis, but fades to yellowish green after a few days. Occasional plants, however, have white or cream-colored corollas upon anthesis that fade to greenish with age. Solanum diploconos most closely resembles S. sciadostylis. Both species have paired crown leaves, broadly expanded stigmas and styles, and frequently some pinnately lobed leaves, especially on the trunk. Solanum diploconos differs from S. sciadostylis in that the vegetative parts of are nearly always glabrous to minutely puberulent, whereas those of S. sciadostylis are densely puberulent and often also pilose with long eglandular hairs. Although both species occasionally produce lobed trunk leaves, those of S. diploconos are usually three- to five-lobed, whereas those of S. sciadostylis may be pinnately compound with up to nine leaflets. Solanum diploconos further differs from S. sciadostylis by having a glabrous style. In addition, the fruits of S. diploconos are obtuse at the apex, lack stone cell aggregates, and are covered with short glandular hairs that break off with age. The fruits of S. sciadostylis are acute at the apex, have obvious stone cell aggregates, and are densely pubescent with longer glandular and eglandular hairs. Solanum diploconos is characteristic of the Atlantic coastal rain forest; S. sciadostylis occupies a more inland range that extends westward to Argentina and Paraguay. Many collections of S. diploconos have a dense but fine covering of hairs on the abaxial surfaces of the leaves and sometimes also on the stems, inflorescence axes, and abaxial corolla surfaces. Some of these collections also have more acuminate corolla lobes than the glabrate specimens of S. diploconos, with the result that the buds appear apiculate when dried. The puberulent collections frequently have the connective prolonged abaxially about 1 mm below the bases of the anther thecae, whereas the connective in the glabrate form is usually equal to the bases of the thecae. The collections with fine puberulence beneath the leaves and with apiculate buds have been treated as a distinct species, Cyphomandra floribunda (Miers) Dunal, but these characteristics are variable and intergrade too much to justify taxonomic distinction. Three collections from northern Rio de Janeiro, eastern Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo (Atamparo 1021, Pirani et al. 181, and Streier 1296) have longer (1-2 mm) and denser pubescence than is typical of the other collections of S. diploconos. No fruits are present on any of the specimens. These densely pubescent collections may represent an infraspecific variant of S. diploconos, but more study is warranted. Solanum diploconos has long been known under the name of Cyphomandra fragrans (Hook.) Sendtn., probably due to the excellent colored illustration of Solanum fragrans Hook. that accompanied the description of this species in Curtis’ Botanical Magazine (Hooker, 1839). However, the publication of Witheringia diploconos Mart. preceded S. fragrans Hook. by a decade. No type specimen for S. fragrans Hook. is known to exist, so the published illustration has been designated as the lectotype. This species is grown as an ornamental due to its small size and attractive flowers and foliage. It has been tried as a fruit crop in New Zealand, but apparently without commercial success. The thick, leathery mesocarp and glandular puberulence of the berry will probably be obstacles to its acceptance as a fruit crop."
wfo-0001026752,"Both S. calidum and S. cacosmum from the eastern Andean slope have shallowly cordate leaves, pubescent fruits, and abundant long hairs on the leaves and stems. Despite these similarities, molecular data indicate that these two species are not closely related (Bohs, in press b). Solanum calidum differs from S. cacosmum in its longer and narrower leaves, very short pedicellar remnants, and globose fruits with obtuse apices. The long hairs, fleshy campanulate corollas, and usually unbranched inflorescences of S. calidum likewise resemble those of S. tenuisetosum, although molecular data rule out a close phylogenetic connection. Solanum calidum differs from S. tenuisetosum in its pubescent fruits, truncate to very shallowly cordate and exclusively unlobed leaves, and shorter anthers, styles, and calyces.
"
wfo-0001026740,"Typical plants of S. cajanumense can be distinguished from other species of Solanum section Pachyphylla by their succulent stems and large coriaceous leaves, their subcoriaceous, stellate, and usually glabrous corollas, their rather broad anther connectives that barely exceed the bases of the anther thecae, their cylindrical styles and truncate stigmas, and their usually pointed fruits with thick woody inflorescence axes. Most collections of S. cajanumense have glandular-puberulent ovaries and young fruits; the hairs apparently break off as the fruits mature. The Hutchison & Bismarck 6528 specimens have noticeably more pubescent fruits than other collections; they may also preserve their pubescence at maturity. Stone cell aggregates can be present or absent in the fruits of this species. The collections grouped here under S. cajanumense are variable with respect to leaf shape, pubescence, and flower and fruit morphology. The type and other specimens collected around Loja, Ecuador, as well as Hutchison & Bismarck 6528 from Cajamarca, Peru, have ovate leaves with deeply cordate bases. The more northerly collections tend toward ovate to elliptic leaves with truncate or shallowly cordate bases; an exception is Goudot s.n. from Colombia, which has deeply cordate bases. Many representatives of S. cajanumense have abundant pubescence on the foliage and axes in the form of long eglandular hairs or in a few cases very dense tomentum on the leaf undersurfaces. Collections from central Ecuador are nearly glabrous on the leaves and axes. In S. cajanumense the pedicels and inflorescence axes thicken conspicuously in ruits. Several collections of S. pendulum also have thickened and woody fruiting pedicels, but molecular data do not show a close relationship between the two species. Solanum viridiflorum Ruiz & Pav. is possibly conspecific with S. cajanumense. Ruiz and Pavón describe and figure this species in their Flora Peruviana (1799) and state that it is allied to S. pendulum, but that it differs from the latter in having unlobed leaves and pubescent fruits. Unfortunately, no specimens of S. viridiflorum could be found and the collection locality of the type material is unknown. Without the type specimens, it is not possible to ascertain whether S. viridiflorum is the same taxon as S. cajanumense. This species has been cultivated and tried as a fruit crop in New Zealand. The fresh fruits are said to be sweet, and Child (1986) describes their flavor as a mixture of peach and Cape gooseberry. The high elevation preferences of this species may be favorable for its cultivation in temperate climates and the lack of stone cell aggregates in the fruits of some accessions will facilitate processing."
wfo-0001029462,"The truncate to cuneate leaf bases, long, slender, curved stamens, and cylindrical styles of this species are unique among the Brazilian representatives of Solanum section Pachyphylla. The structure of the androecium resembles that of the S. diploconos clade, but the anthers of S. melissarum are much longer than any of the species of the clade. In addition, S. melissarum differs in its membranaceous corolla, slender stigma and style, and glabrous fruits. The long narrow anthers, cylindrical styles, and glabrous fruits of S. melissarum resemble features found in Andean taxa such as S. tenuisetosum, S. pendulum, and S. circinatum, but S. melissarum differs from each of these species in many characters. Molecular data also point to a rather isolated phylogenetic position for this species. Several characters exhibit variation throughout the geographical range of S. melissarum. Collections from the northern part of the range (Bahia, Espírito Santo, and Minas Gerais) are often nearly glabrous. Pubescence tends to increase southward. There is also some variation in calyx size. Most collections have large calyces with a radius of 5-7 mm and narrow lobes ca. 3-4 mm long and 1.5-2 mm wide. A few specimens, especially from the Rio de Janeiro area, have calyx radii measuring ca. 3 mm with shorter and relatively broader lobes ca. 1.5-2 mm long and 1.5-2 mm wide. These latter collections, which include the types of Cyphomandra divaricata var. herbacea, C. capsicoides, C. ciliata, C. oxyphylla, and C. laxiflora, also have relatively broad leaf blades and may have minutely puberulent fruits. Further studies are needed to determine if this variation is significant enough to be recognized taxonomically."
wfo-0001026733,"Although S. cacosmum bears a close morphological resemblance to S. tegore, molecular data indicate that it may be unrelated to the latter species and instead is a close relative of S. exiguum, whereas S. tegore belongs to the S. circinatum clade (Bohs, in press b). All three species have abundant pubescence on the stems, leaves, and fruits, closely spaced pedicels leaving prominent pedicellar remnants, greenish or whitish stellate corollas, slender anthers, and cylindrical styles. Solanum cacosmum and S. exiguum have pointed fruits, whereas those of S. tegore are obtuse at the apex. At least some specimens of S. tegore have pinnately lobed trunk leaves, a character found in many species of the S. circinatum clade. Solanum cacosmum differs from the other two species in its long shining stem and leaf hairs. Solanum cacosmum and S. exiguum have contiguous ranges in the western Amazon, whereas S. tegore is found around the mouth of the Amazon in eastern Brazil. A few anomalous collections have been determined as S. cacosmum, but further study may indicate that they either do not belong to this species or should be segregated as a distinct taxon. Prance et al. 25404 from Pará, Brazil has the long shining hairs and acute fruits characteristic of S. cacosmum but falls within the geographical range of S. tegore. Three Ecuadorian collections (Tirado et al. 106, Harling & Andersson 11995 and 17377) conform to S. cacosmum in their pubescence and leaf shape, but they differ from the rest of the material in several characters. For instance, the pedicels are articulated at the base and leave almost no pedicellar remnants on the axis. The flowers are larger in these collections, with corolla lobes up to 12-14 mm, anthers about 8 mm long, and broader stigmas about 1 mm in diameter. The corolla lobes and vegetative parts are not as copiously glandular-pubescent as in other collections of S. cacosmum. Fruits are not present in these collections, so it cannot be determined if they have the distinctive pointed fuisform outline found in typical specimens of S. cacosmum.
"
wfo-0001030023,"Solanum occultum closely resembles S. endopogon in its narrow corolla lobes bordered by conspicuous hairs, its long narrow anthers, and its slender styles dilated at the apices into expanded peltiform stigmas. As in S. endopogon, the inflorescences can become elongated and often bear leaflike bracts near the base, but the inflorescences of S. occultum are highly branched whereas those of S. endopogon are usually unbranched or forked. The floral parts of S. occultum are smaller than those of S. endopogon and the flower buds are acute rather than obtuse at the apices. Both S. occultum and a subspecies of S. endopogon from the Guianas have puberulent fruits. Molecular data place S. occultum and S. endopogon on the S. circinatum clade. Solanum occultum is sympatric with S. endopogon subsp. endopogon in the western Amazon. Because of the morphological similarity between the two species, Bohs (1986) originally considered S. occultum to be a variety of S. endopogon. Solanum occultum also resembles S. circinatum in many vegetative and floral features, particularly in its acute flower buds, acute corolla lobes, and smaller floral parts. Stigma diameter in S. occultum is roughly intermediate between that of S. circinatum and S. endopogon. Solanum occultum also occurs largely in the area of overlap between the ranges of S. circinatum and S. endopogon. The intermediacy in morphology and distribution suggest that S. occultum may be a hybrid derivative of S. circinatum and S. endopogon established in the area of contact between the latter two species. To test this hypothesis, pollen was examined from herbarium sheets of S. occultum, S. circinatum, and S. endopogon collected in areas where all three species co-occur in eastern Ecuador and Peru. Pollen stainability, as assessed by treatment with aniline blue/lactophenol, did not differ significantly between the three species (S. occultum: x = 88.8%, s = 9.57, n = 14; S. endopogon: x = 90.0%, s = 6.26, n = 6; S. circinatum: x = 94.3%, s = 4.48, n = 4). These results do not support the idea of a hybrid origin of S. occultum; if it is indeed a hybrid, it has high pollen fertility. Further biosystematic studies in the field and greenhouse will elucidate the relationships among these three putatively related species."
wfo-0001028017,"Solanum fortunense can be identified from Bitter's detailed Latin description and from photographs of the holotype (destroyed in Berlin during World War II) showing the distinctive elongated fruits and elliptic leaves with cuneate bases. Although originally described from Costa Rica, all extant specimens were collected from Panama until recent expeditions rediscovered this species in Costa Rica. The Panamanian collections agree with Bitter's protologue except for the glabrate rather than pubescent leaves and stems and the different structure of the gynoecium. Bitter describes the style as being obviously thickened into the subpeltate stigma nearly 1.5 mm in diameter. Herbarium and living specimens have very small stigmas and cylindrical styles. The Costa Rican collections are similar to Panamanian material except for denser and longer pubescence on the leaves and axes. The narrow, tapered anthers and truncate stigma of S. fortunense are characteristic of the S. circinatum clade, and it is possible that S. fortunense belongs to this group. However, it also resembles S. tobagense, which also has elliptic leaves with cuneate bases and pointed fruits. The leaves of S. fortunense are larger than those of S. tobagense and the fruits of S. fortunense are glabrous rather than puberulent.
"
wfo-0001027821,"Solanum endopogon subsp. guianensis resembles subsp. endopogon in all aspects of floral and vegetative morphology except for the dense puberulence of the branches, abaxial leaf surfaces, inflorescence axes, corolla lobes, and fruits. The range of subsp. guianense is separated from that of subsp. endopogon by a disjunction of nearly 1500 km.
"
wfo-0001027819,"Solanum endopogon is one of the most distinctive species in the Cyphomandra clade, and can be recognized by its obtuse flower buds, long narrow corolla lobes bordered by conspicuous hairs, long narrow anthers, and long slender style strongly dilated at the summit into a broad stigma. The inflorescences are often spectacularly long and sometimes bear small leaflike bracts near the base. Solanum endopogon closely resembles S. occultum, and both have sympatric distributions in the western part of the Amazon basin. However, S. endopogon, unlike S. occultum, has unbranched or forked inflorescences, obtuse flower buds, very long corolla lobes and anthers, and a very broad stigma. Both S. endopogon subsp. guianense and S. occultum have puberulent fruits. Two subspecies are recognized within S. endopogon based on their differences in pubescence and disjunct distributions. Subspecies endopogon has branches, petioles, inflorescence axes, and abaxial leaf surfaces glabrous to sparsely and minutely puberulent, glabrous fruits and with a distribution in western Amazon. Subspecies guianense has branches, petioles, inflorescence axes, and abaxial leaf surfaces densely puberulent, puberulent fruits (at least when young) and distribution in French Guiana and eastern Brazil.
"
wfo-0001027820,"This subspecies differs from Solanum endopogon subsp. guianense in its western Amazonian distribution and in being nearly glabrous. Its often pinnately lobed trunk leaves, elongated inflorescences with short pedicellar remnants, long narrow anthers, and obtuse glabrous fruits ressemble those of S. circinatum. Solanum endopogon subsp. endopogon can easily be distinguished from S. circinatum by floral characters, but it is often very difficult to distinguish fruiting specimens of the two taxa from lowland Ecuador and Peru. Although many specimens of this subspecies are almost completely glabrous, some collections, especially those from eastern Ecuador, are sparsely and minutely puberulent on the stems, inflorescence axes, and abaxial leaf surfaces. These hairs are only visible under magnification and do not approach the density and conspicuousness of the puberulence seen in subsp. guianense.
"
wfo-0001030902,"Solanum roseum is most closely related to S. betaceum, S. maternum, and S. unilobum. Solanum roseum, S. maternum, and S. unilobum are endemic to Bolivia, whereas the native range of S. betaceum extends from southern Bolivia into northwestern Argentina. The pinkish, stellate corollas of S. roseum are similar to those of S. betaceum and S. maternum, but S. roseum differs in its nearly glabrous leaves and stems, narrow leaf blades, and very large seeds. Hybrids have been produced in the greenhouse between S. betaceum and S. roseum (Bohs, 1991) and molecular data confirm that all four species are closely related (Bohs, in press b). Solanum roseum is often nearly indistinguishable from S. unilobum on herbarium sheets. Both species are found in the Bolivian Yungas, but the range of S. unilobum also extends to forests of central Bolivia. Solanum roseum occurs above 1500 m in elevation, whereas S. unilobum is found more often at lower elevations. Both species have ovate, cordate leaf blades and sparse, inconspicuous pubescence, but S. unilobum has broader leaves with deeper basal lobes and is generally more pubescent than S. roseum. Solanum roseum has purplish or reddish corollas with dark reddish connectives, in contrast with the green, yellow green, or whitish corollas and bright yellow anther connectives of S. unilobum. The stigma of S. roseum, although slightly dilated at the apex of the style, is not as broad as that of S. unilobum and lacks the two conspicuous apical glands present in the latter species. Solanum roseum can be distinguished from all other species in Solanum section Pachyphylla by its unusually large and conspicuously brown-pubescent seeds. Other species of the section with large seeds, such as S. circinatum, S. endopogon, and S. sibundoyense, have whitish seed hairs generally less than 1 mm long. The collection of Plowman and Davis 4929 (F, GH) from Prov. Paucartambo, Dept. Cuzco, Peru may belong to S. roseum. The fruits and seeds agree with those of S. roseum, but the leaves have truncate or cuneate rather than cordate bases. The specimens bear only fruits, so a decision to include them in S. roseum or describe them as a new species must await further collections in Peru."
wfo-0001032233,"Solanum unilobum is most similar to S. roseum; both species are nearly glabrous and have similar anthers and gynoecia. Solanum unilobum may be distinguished from S. roseum by its relatively broader and less coriaceous leaf blades, its greenish rather than reddish corollas, its yellow rather than reddish anther connectives, and its smaller seeds. The two species can be very difficult to distinguish on herbarium sheets when mature fruits with seeds are not present. Both occur in the Bolivian uplands. Solanum unilobum also resembles S. obliquum from the eastern Andean slopes of Peru. It differs from the latter species in its nearly glabrous leaves and broadly spaced pedicels articulated above the base. Three collections show some anomalous features. Fleischmann 157 has pointed, glandular-puberulent fruits, unlike the glabrous ones usually seen in S. unilobum. Williams 373 and Bernardi et al. 16817 are rather densely are rather densely puberulent on the vegetative parts, thus resembling S. obliquum more than S. unilobum. All of these collections occur well within the distributional range of S. unilobum and they are here considered as that species. Solanum unilobum, along with S. roseum and S. maternum, is part of a suite of species most closely related to the cultivated tree tomato, S. betaceum (Bohs, in press b). Greenhouse pollinations among these four taxa showed successful pollen tube growth and the development of full-sized fruits and vigorous F1 plants in crossing combinations between several accessions of S. unilobum, S. betaceum, and S. maternum (Bohs, 1991; Bohs & Nelson, 1997). It is probable that S. unilobum has played a role in the origin and evolution of the tree tomato. This species may be a source of genes to be used in breeding and improvement programs for S. betaceum."
wfo-0001030151,"Solanum oxyphyllum is unique in Solanum section Pachyphylla in having the tips of the anthers united into a ring. The membranaceous elliptic leaves with subcordate to decurrent bases are also distinctive. The leaves and fruits resemble those of some specimens of S. diversifolium, and ITS data suggest a close relationship among these species. However, the flowers of S. oxyphyllum and S. diversifolium are quite different. Those of S. diversifolium have purplish urceolate corollas, short thick anthers with very swollen connectives, and relatively broad styles and stigmas, whereas the flowers of S. oxyphyllum resemble those of S. cacosmum and members of the S. circinatum group in their greenish stellate corollas, long slender anthers, and narrow styles and stigmas. Like S. diversifolium and S. pendulum, some specimens of S. oxyphyllum have pinnately compound leaves."
wfo-0001026534,"Solanum betaceum is most closely related to S. maternum; both species have deeply cordate and pubescent leaf blades, pinkish subcoriaceous stellate corollas, cylindrical styles and unexpanded stigmas, and large ellipsoidal juicy fruits that are edible at maturity. Solanum betaceum differs from S. maternum (and the other species in the S. betaceum clade) in its orange or reddish fruits and self-compatible breeding system. The natural range and place of origin of S. betaceum was unknown until recently. This species is grown worldwide in subtropical areas and herbarium specimens exist from nearly all countries in the Western Hemisphere. Many accounts describe S. betaceum as being known only from cultivation. However, several botanists (Brücher, 1968, 1977; J. Solomon, pers. comm.; E. Zardini, pers. comm.) reported wild populations of S. betaceum from southern Bolivia and adjacent areas of northwestern Argentina in the floristic province known as the “bosque Tucumano-Boliviano” (Cabrera, 1976). Herbarium specimens from these areas show no morphological differences from those of other regions of Latin America and the Eastern Hemisphere. Recent botanical expeditions to southern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina in 1998-2000 confirmed the existence of wild populations of S. betaceum in this region. Wild plants were morphologically indistinguishable from cultivated individuals and wild plants also had a self-compatible breeding system. There is virtually no doubt that these are truly wild individuals, not feral plants established from cultivated tree tomatoes. The plants are common in undisturbed forest and occupy an extensive range from Dept. Tarija, Bolivia to Provs. Salta and Jujuy in Argentina. ITS sequences from wild individuals were identical or nearly so to those of cultivated tree tomatoes from New Zealand and other parts of Latin America. It is unknown how and when S. betaceum spread from southern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina to northwestern South America where it is most commonly cultivated today. The lack of morphological and molecular divergence between wild and cultivated S. betaceum accessions argues for a relatively recent, possibly post-Conquest, introduction into northwestern South America. Routes of commerce from colonial towns such as Salta and Jujuy in Argentina and Tarija in Bolivia may have extended through Potosí, Bolivia and thence to Lima, Peru and sites father north. Alternatively, the Incas may have spread this fruit crop throughout their empire, which extended in pre-Conquest times from Colombia to Argentina. Although S. betaceum is widely grown on a local scale in Latin America, New Zealand is the only country to commercially market and export this species. The New Zealanders changed the name to “tamarillo” to avoid confusion with the tomato, S. lycopersicum. They have also instituted breeding and improvement programs for this species using germplasm from variants of S. betaceum as well as other species in the S. betaceum clade. Greenhouse crossing trials among accessions of S. betaceum, S. maternum, S. roseum, and S. unilobum showed that fertile hybrids can be formed in at least some crossing combinations of S. betaceum with the other species (Bohs, 1991; Bohs & Nelson, 1997). Thus, it seems possible to introduce desirable genes into S. betaceum using conventional plant breeding methods. However, there has not been wholesale acceptance of S. betaceum fruits outside New Zealand, and even in New Zealand tamarillo cultivation appears to be on the decline. Nonetheless, additional wild populations of S. betaceum should be located in South America and both in situ and ex situ germplasm preservation of this species should be a priority."
wfo-0001030570,"Solanum proteanthum resembles S. circinatum and S. endopogon in its nearly glabrous and often pinnately lobed leaves, glabrous obtuse fruits with large stone cell aggregates, and large seeds. It differs from these two species in having oblong or elliptic-oblong leaves with truncate or shallowly cordate bases and short unbranched inflorescences with obvious pedicellar remnants. The anthers and styles are shorter than in other members of the S. circinatum clade and the campanulate corolla of S. proteanthum differs from the stellate corollas found in most members of this clade. Most collections of S. proteanthum have campanulate corollas with tubes about 3-6 mm long and calyx radii about 3-6 mm long. Collections from Suriname differ in having stellate corollas with tubes only 2-3 mm long and vary small calyces with radii ca. 2-4 mm. The collections with stellate corollas look very similar to S. circinatum except for their oblong leaves, and it has been suggested that the Suriname populations may be the result of hybridization between S. proteanthum and S. circinatum (Bohs, 1988). Only three herbarium specimens in flower are available from this area, and all have high pollen stainability (> 90%). Further biosystematic studies of these two species are needed to shed light on their relationships. Several collections from Amazonian Brazil differ from both the campanulate and stellate corolla forms of S. proteanthum in having very small flowers with corolla lobes only 5-6 mm long and calyx radii only ca. 1-2 mm. Except for their small flowers, they resemble the other collections of S. proteanthum. In reference to the diversity in floral morphology displayed by this species throughout its range, the epithet was taken from Proteus, a figure in Greek mythology capable of assuming different forms (Bohs, 1995)."
wfo-0001031218,"Solanum sibundoyense has stellate corollas, slender anthers, truncate stigmas, and fruits with stone cell aggregates as are typical of members of the S. circinatum clade. It most closely resembles S. circinatum, but the corollas are purplish rather than green and the leaf blades are always unlobed. This species is difficult to distinguish from S. circinatum on herbarium sheets. Solanum sibundoyense produces some of the largest fruits known in section Pachyphylla. The fruit pulp is sweet, juicy, and pleasant-tasting and an attractive purplish layer surrounds the seeds. Although a good candidate for trial as a fruit crop, it may be difficult to successfully cultivate this species outside the specialized climate of southern Colombia where it is native."
wfo-0001031695,"This species can be recognized by its rather large calyces, large campanulate corollas, and the abundant long hairs found on the vegetative parts. Many specimens have distinctive two- or three-lobed leaves. Some collectors have described S. tenuisetosum as being a vine and very young plants do have twining stems. When older, however, a weakly woody trunk is formed with tiers of spreading branches as is typical for many other species in the Pachyphylla group. It is likely that these spreading branches do not really twine, but are scandent on surrounding vegetation. Molecular place S. tenuisetosum within the S. circinatum clade, but this species shares several morphological characters with unrelated species in Solanum section Pachyphylla. Its campanulate corollas, large calyces, and slightly dilated styles are similar to those of S. pendulum. The copious long hairs of S. tenuisetosum are also found in S. calidum and S. cacosmum, but S. tenuisetosum differs from the latter two species in flower and fruit characters. Its large calyces, campanulate corollas, and lobed trunk leaves are similar to those of S. proteanthum, another species in the S. circinatum clade."
wfo-0001031135,"Solanum sciadostylis can be distinguished from all other species in Solanum section Pachyphylla by its puberulent style. Morphological features that S. sciadostylis shares with other members of the S. diploconos clade such as S. diploconos and S. latiflorum include fleshy campanulate corollas, broad curved stamens with the connective abruptly narrowed above the base, expanded styles and stigmas, and puberulent fruits. Solanum sciadostylis most closely resembles S. diploconos. Both species share the traits enumerated above, as well as paired crown leaves, frequently pinnately lobed trunk leaves, and strongly dilated stigmas and styles. Solanum sciadostylis differs in its puberulent style, abundant vegetative pubescence, and acute fruits containing stone cell aggregates. A few collections from Paraná and São Paulo, Brazil (Hatschbach 23256, Hatschbach 40309, Krapovickas & Cristóbal 33649, and Hammar 5882) are distinctive in having elongated fusiform fruits and abundant long (3-4 mm) hairs on the stems, leaves, and inflorescences. The anther connectives in these collections are somewhat broader than usual and are very pronounced on the adaxial side, but otherwise the floral structure conforms to typical S. sciadostylis. "
wfo-0001029404,"Solanum maternum belongs to a complex of closely related taxa from Bolivia, which includes S. roseum, S. unilobum, and S. betaceum, the cultivated tree tomato. Solanum maternum is morphologically very similar to S. betaceum, and the two species are difficult to distinguish from herbarium material alone. Differences include slightly longer and less dense pubescence, more shallowly cordate leaves, and slightly wider anther connectives in S. maternum. Living material differs from S. betaceum in flower and fruit color. Solanum maternum has purplish or pinkish corollas with a deep purple star at base, whereas S. betaceum generally has uniformly white or pinkish corollas. The fruits of S. maternum are yellow or light orange, not dark orange or reddish as is typical of S. betaceum, although some forms of S. betaceum may have yellowish or light orange fruits. Fruits of S. maternum usually have a prominent apiculum or “nipple” at the distal end; those of S. betaceum may be acute distally, but usually lack an obvious apiculum. The reddish or purplish corollas of S. maternum resemble those of S. roseum, but the latter species is nearly glabrous and has much larger seeds than S. maternum. Solanum maternum differs from S. unilobum in its corolla color (S. unilobum has greenish corollas), its unexpanded style and small stigma, and its more abundant pubescence. Solanum maternum grows wild in upland areas of Bolivia in the Departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. Solanum unilobum also occurs in this area, but is generally found at lower elevations (300-1700 m). Solanum roseum has been found only farther to the northwest in the Department of La Paz, and its range is probably not sympatric with that of S. maternum. Wild populations of S. betaceum have been located in southern Bolivia in Dept. Tarija and in adjacent areas of northwestern Argentina (L. Bohs, unpub. data). Thus far the ranges of S. maternum and S. betaceum do not appear to be sympatric, although more field work is needed to ascertain the extent of these species in southern Bolivia. In addition to morphological similarity, crossing data indicate a close relationship among S. maternum, S. betaceum, S. roseum, and S. unilobum. Crossing studies show that S. betaceum will form fertile hybrids in at least some combinations with S. maternum, S. roseum and S. unilobum (Bohs, 1991; Bohs & Nelson, 1997). Solanum maternum, S. roseum, and S. unilobum are self-incompatible, whereas all accessions of S. betaceum, both wild and cultivated, that have been tested are self-compatible (Bohs, 1991; Bohs & Nelson, 1997; L. Bohs, unpub. data). Molecular sequence data also confirm that these four species are closely related; ITS sequences from the four taxa are identical or nearly so (Bohs, in press b). The close morphological resemblance of S. maternum to S. betaceum suggests that S. maternum may be the closest wild relative of the tree tomato. Solanum maternum should be explored as a source of useful genes for improvement of the tree tomato, and may itself be valuable as an economic fruit crop."
wfo-0001027620,"Solanum diversifolium subsp. chloranthum is distinct from subsp. diversifolium in having elliptic or nearly globose fruits with obtuse apices and large seeds ca. 4-5 mm in diameter. Although some variation occurs in calyx size and shape, no representatives of subsp. chloranthum have calyx lobes more than 6 mm long. The Central American collections differ from those of western Venezuela in having the crown leaves more often pinnately compound, the indumentum sparsely to densely pilose with eglandular curled hairs up to 2 mm long, and the inflorescence frequently trifid with a long peduncle up to about 20 cm in length. The Central American collections also have a more lowland range (up to 400 m elevation). More extensive field work in this area may clarify the relationship between the Central and South American collections.
"
wfo-0001027618,"This distinctive species can be recognized by its urceolate corollas, usually pinnately compound leaves, and short, cureved stamens with broad connectives. It most closely resembles S. pendulum of Peru and Bolivia, but differs in its lack of dense tomentum on the abaxial corolla surface. At least two morphological and geographical entities can be discerned within S. diversifolium, and these are recognized as subspecies. They are mainly distinguished by fruit characters, which are often lacking in herbarium material; further work may reveal that they are better recognized as separate species. Other than differences in calyx morphology, which exhibits considerable local variation, the two subspecies are very similar in vegetative and floral characters. Subspecies diversifolium has elongated fruits acute at apex and seeds 2-3 mm in diameter, while subspecies chloranthum has ellipsoidal to globose fruits ellipsoidal obtuse at apex and seeds 4-5 mm in diameter."
wfo-0001027621,"The elongated fruits and relatively small seeds of subsp. diversifolium distinguish it from subsp. chloranthum. Subspecies diversifolium is restricted to the mountians of coastal Venezuela and is geographically separated from subsp. chloranthum by the Yaracuy depression in north-central Venezuela that runs between the Cordillera Mérida and the Cordillera de la Costa. Considerable local variation occurs within subsp. diversifolium, perhaps corresponding to isolated populations occupying different peaks of the highly dissected Coastal Cordillera. Steyermark (1979) divided the Coastal Cordillera into several refuges and dispersal centers, emphasizing the distinctness of floristic elements in isolated portions of this range. Specimens from Miranda, Distrito Federal, and Aragua near Colonia Tovar have very large calyces (radius 6-11 mm, lobes 4-9 x 3-4 mm). Collections from Colonia Tovar are nearly glabrous and were formerly segregated as a separate species, Cyphomandra glabra Pittier (Pittier, 1947). These collections are probably better viewed as local variants of subsp. diversifolium. Pittier's name is illegitimate because he provided no Latin diagnosis. Specimens collected in Aragua near Choroni or in the Parque Nacional Henri Pittier differ from the other representatives of subsp. diversifolium in their small calyces (radius 3-4 mm, lobes 1-3 x 1.5-2.5 mm). Collections from the Peninsula of Paria in Estado Sucre may also have small calyces, but the available material is not sufficient to critically evaluate this character.
"
wfo-0001027889,"Bohs (1994) postulated a close relationship between S. exiguum and S. pendulum because both have dense tomentum on the abaxial corolla surfaces. Molecular data, however, indicate that S. exiguum and S. pendulum are not closely related and instead that S. exiguum is sister to S. cacosmum. Solanum exiguum and S. cacosmum have abundant pubescence on the stems, leaves, and fruits, closely spaced pedicels leaving prominent pedicellar remnants, greenish or whitish stellate corollas, slender anthers, cylindrical styles, and pointed fruits. Solanum cacosmum and S. exiguum occupy contiguous ranges in the western Amazon basin, with S. exiguum endemic to Bolivia and S. cacosmum found in Ecuador, Peru, and western Brazil. Solanum cacosmum differs from S. exiguum in its long shining stems and leaf hairs and it lacks the dense corolla pubescence typical of of the latter species. A new epithet was required when this species was transferred to Solanum because of conflict with the existing name S. beniense De Wild. (Nicolson, 1993)."
wfo-0001025838,"Solanum aligerum has the widest range of all the New World members of the Dulcamaroid clade, occurring all down the cordilleras of the continents. In spite of this huge range, the species is remarkably uniform in general aspect, but varies considerably in pubescence. In Bolivia, several populations have been found with plants that are uniformly and densely pubescent with dendritic trichomes over all plant parts; at one time I thought these were a new species and annotated some material as such, but in studying the Dulcamaroid clade in detail it has become apparent that these plants are merely extremes in this widespread species. They agree with other Bolivian material of S. aligerum in all other respects. It would be interesting to investigate if this pubescence variation is due to some habitat variation not apparent from herbarium labels. Solanum aligerum is extremely similar to S. pubigerum, with which it broadly overlaps in central Mexico and Central America. The two species can be very difficult to distinguish, but S. aligerum has dendritic (rather than simple) trichomes concentrated in the veins axils or over the entire lamina, rather than being found mostly along the midrib on the leaf undersides. Flowers are larger in S. aligerum with the calyx lobes quadrate rather than deltate (this can be difficult to see), and the berries of S. aligerum are also larger and usually black or blackish green, rather than red, when ripe. The stems of S. aligerum are often (but not always) prominently winged, while those of S. pubigerum are never so. In general the two species appear to not occupy the same forest types where their ranges overlap. The absence of S. aligerum in Colombia and Ecuador could indicate the northern and southern populations are in the process of differentation. Without the locality being revealed, it is impossible to distinguish a plant as coming from any particular area, so I am confident that these all represent a single taxon. Molecular studies at the population and geographical level may reveal some differentiating characters. The holotype of S. aligerum was destroyed in Berlin and no duplicates have yet been traced. Lectotypification will await a search of other herbaria where Schiede’s duplicates may have been sent. Many syntypes exist for S. pterocladum, as Mandon’s collections were widely distributed and no herbarium was cited in the original publication."
wfo-0001027323,"Solanum cucullatum is closely related to S. abitaguense and is difficult to tell from that species on the herbarium sheet. Both species grow along streams in forest, have large flowers and fruits, and distinctive fruit pubescence (see discussion for S. abitaguense). Characters useful in distinguishing S. cucullatum from S. abitaguense are its unwinged greyish stems, more elongate hooded buds, and its extremely fleshy flowers with doubly-hooded petal tips. In live plants the leaves of S. cucullatum have matte surfaces, while those of S. abitaguense are somewhat glossy. The abaxial petal surfaces of the flowers of S. cucullatum dry greenish-pink. Small individuals of S. cucullatum appear to be female sterile, while larger plants have hermaphroditic flowers. This does not appear to be the case in S. abitaguense. Many more collections of S. cucullatum are needed to establish this as a pattern in the species."
wfo-0001028328,"Although one of the tallest species of sect. Torva, it also has the smallest flowers. Due to its large size and entire, bicolorous leaves, it resembles the South American species S. albidum and S. whalenii. However, the flowers of S. hayesii are much smaller and the species is distributed further to the north, in Central America and Colombia. It is also similar to the sympatric S. fosbergianum, which also has very small flowers, but in S. fosbergianum the leaf undersides are sparsely pubescent with sessile stellae rather than densely pubescent with stalked stellae. Juvenile plants of S. hayesii have prickles on the stems and petioles, but flowering branches lack them. Curiously, S. hayesii has been commonly collected in Nicaragua and Panama, but no specimens are known from Costa Rica despite the occurrence of apparently suitable habitats.
"
wfo-0001028524,"Solanum iltisii is distinguished from all other species in section Brevantherum by the ferrugineous hairs on young stems and peduncles that are partly long, thick-stalked, and echinoid, rounded, obtuse or acute leaf bases, thin, translucent calyces, warty fruits, and large seeds."
wfo-0001020027,"Capsicum caatingae is a member of the Caatinga Clade (Carrizo García et al. 2016) and is closely related to C. parvifolium, with which it is sympatric in Brazil; the two species have been confused in literature and in herbaria. Capsicum caatingae is an unusual species with a combination of uncommon features rarely found amongst its congeners: arborescent habit, with indefinite growth of the main stem reaching up to 6 m high (15 m fide Bautista & Pinto 1023), very congested inflorescences with up to 20 or more flowers per node, corolla with varied colours (lobes white edged, then deep purple or variations of purple colour, tube with greenish-yellow to yellowish-white centre) and terete and inflated fruiting pedicels with a strong annular constriction at the junction with the calyx base, similar to C. chinense and a few other species (C. minutiflorum, C. lanceolatum and C. regale). Capsicum caatingae differs from C. parvifolium in the absence of calyx appendages (five appendages in C. parvifolium), the number of flowers per node (up to 20 or more flowers vs. not more than seven flowers in C. parvifolium) and the fruit and seed colour (red berry with pale yellow seeds vs. greenish-golden yellow translucent berry with brownish-black seeds in C. parvifolium). Capsicum caatingae is sometimes sympatric with C. longidentatum from which it differs by its arborescent growth (vs. shrubby growth), the indumentum mostly of simple trichomes (vs. indumentum of branched and dendritic trichomes), the lack of calyx appendages (vs. five, rarely six, calyx appendages), the mostly purple corolla (vs. corolla white with greenish-yellow spots) and the pungent red fruit with pale yellow seeds (vs. non-pungent probably yellowish-green fruit with brown to brownish-black seeds)."
wfo-0001028183,"Solanum goodspeedii is characterized by the glabrate stems, petioles, and peduncles, scabrous adaxial leaf surfaces, stipitate-glandular calyces, and yellowish granular-punctate lower leaf surfaces. The species is similar to and possibly closely related to S. umbellatum but S. goodspeedii has longer anthers, the plant is less pubescent, the calyx less deeply lobed, and the contrast between the dark calyx and light corolla in bud is more marked. It differs from the very poorly known and partially sympatric S. fulgens which has larger leaves that are more decurrent at the base and much more tomentose calyces."
wfo-0001028482,"Solanum humboldtianum is very similar morphologically to S. goniocaulon S. Knapp of southern Ecuador and adjacent northern Peru and to S. laurifrons Bitter of the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia (see Knapp 2002). The three species share papillate new growth, angular fleshy stems, markedly discolorous leaves that dry yellowish beneath, and cucullate petal apices. They differ in a variety of morphological characters such as habit and stem morphology. Solanum humboldtianum is also a scandent or somewhat lianescent shrub, a habit not recorded in other similar species. Knapp (2002) assigned the species of section Geminata to a series of species groups based on seed and leaf morphology, it remains to be seen if these hold up using molecular data. In Knapp’s (2002) scheme S. goniocaulon is a member of the S. arboreum species group, all with ovoid seeds. It may be that S. humboldtianum is closely related, as well as morphologically similar to, S. goniocaulon. Studies undertaken in the forests of Bojacá and El Soche, in the Department of Cundinamarca, indicate that today Solanum humboldtianum grows in areas with slopes of 45-55º in forests with a composition of primarily secondary species (J.C. Granados-Tochoy et al., unpubl. data). "
wfo-0001025699,"Solanum acropterum is a distinctive species with its strongly winged, completely glabrous pedicels and ellipsoid berries. The inflorescences are borne one to a short shoot, making the flower-bearing portion of the plant look somewhat bushy. In contrast to the other members of the S. havanense group, the flowers of S. acropterum are white rather than purple. Mature fruits of S. acropterum are not known, but appear to be ellipsoid and are likely to be blueish green, as are the fruits of S. havanense. Solanum acropterum is known only from the John Crow Mountains and a few other forest habitats in central Jamaica; due to this restricted distribution on a single island it is likely to be of conservation concern (Yoder et al., in prep.), and was listed in 1997 as Rare (Walter & Gillett, 1998). This species can be assigned a preliminary conservation status (sensu IUCN, 2001) of Vulnerable (VU), but there is a strong basis to consider S. acropterum as Endangered (EN) due to paucity of collections and its status as a single island endemic (Yoder, 2006). Grisebach cited two collections in his original description of Solanum acropterum, Waters s.n. and Wilson s.n., both at K. The Waters sheet (K000005250) has been chosen as the lectotype because it has both flowers and fruit. Neither sheet has specific collecting locality information."
wfo-0001030809,"Solanum reitzii is most closely related to S. pseudoquina, a widespread species of southeastern Brazil, with which it shares the unusual character of dimorphic anthers with round, very small pores. Solanum reitzii differs from S. pseudoquina in its dense indument of golden uniseriate trichomes, and its slightly smaller flowers. Solanum reitzii may be an isolate of the more widespread and closely related S. pseudoquina.  Solanum reitzii is one of the most temperate members of section Geminata, growing in Araucaria angustifolia forests as an understory shrub. These habitats are rapidly disappearing; this accounts for the paucity of collections of S. reitzii. "
wfo-0001032165,"Solanum turgidum is related to S. triste and S. chlamydogynum, both also of coastal Venezuela (see Knapp, 1991b). They share several homoplastic synapomorphies: branched pubescence, thickened calyx lobes and incrassate seed margins. Solanum turgidum is easily distinguished from S. triste or S. chlamydogynum in its greenish flowers, glabrous leaves, and short, stout fruting pedicels. The trichomes on the style base of S. turgidum appear uniseriate and simple under the dissecting microscope, but when viewed at high magnifications with the SEM, it is clear that at least some of them are furcate (see Fig. 11 in Knapp, 2002). This possession of both branched and simple trichomes is common in the S. sessile species group. Solanum turgidum grows in low cloud forest, under closed canopy. The plants have a clumped distribution, and apparently are growing in old light gaps in the forest. Solanum turgidum is common where it occurs, but is uncommon on a regional scale."
wfo-1000025654,"Specimens of Athenaea altoserranae have been variously identified in herbaria as Aureliana fasciculata (Vell.) Sendtn., Aureliana fasciculata var. longifolia (Sendtn.) Hunz. and Barboza or Aureliana glomuliflora Sendtn. - all currently recognised as synonyms of the widespread glabrous species Athenaea fasciculata (Vell.) I.M.C. Rodrigues & Stehmann. Athenaea fasciculata is the most widespread species of the genus and is distributed along the Atlantic rain forest from southern to north-eastern Brazil, but also occurs south to Paraguay and Argentina and west to eastern Peru and Bolivia (see Rodrigues et al. 2019). Athenaea altoserranae is sympatric with A. fasciculata, A. cuspidata, A. pogogena, A. picta, A. sellowiana and A. wettsteiniana. Athenaea altoserranae can be distinguished from A. fasciculata s.l. by its erect and long-lanceolate leaves clustered at the tips of shoots versus broader leaves evenly spaced along the stem, warty versus smooth fruiting pedicels and dark brown versus green mature fruits. Phylogenetic studies of the group, using molecular data (plastid and nuclear markers), provide additional support for the distinction of these populations. Zamberlan et al. (2015) found that Athenaea altoserranae (as Aureliana sp. nov.) does not belong to the same clade as Aureliana fasciculata, but is, instead, a member of a clade with A. sellowiana (Sendtn.) I.M.C. Rodrigues & Stehmann and A. velutina (Sendtn.) D'Arcy that is sister to Athenaea pogogena (Moric.) Sendtn. + Athenaea cuspidata Witasek +Athenaea picta (Mart.) Sendtn. Athenaea sellowiana is also morphologically similar to A. altoserranae in its glabrous stems and leaves and is broadly sympatric with it in São Paulo State. The two species can be distinguished by flower texture (calyx and corolla fleshy in A. sellowiana and foliaceous in A. altoserranae) and the more strictly lanceolate leaves of A. altoserranae (versus narrowly oblanceolate, elliptic or oblong leaves in A. sellowiana).
"
wfo-0001031283,"Solanum sitiens is sister to S. lycopersicoides, differences between can be seen in the key and in the discussion of S. lycopersicoides above. Solanum sitiens has more dissected leaves than S. lycopersicoides and a yellowish, rather than purple or black, fruit. Solanum sitiens is a small shrub that apparently holds onto its fruits for a long time, where they turn papery and dry. Flowering in S. sitiens appears to peak in November with a minor flowering episode in January to May, but the number of specimens collected is very small and this bimodality may be merely a collecting artifact. Solanum sitiens and S. lycopersicoides are both endemics of the western Andean deserts of Peru and Chile, and adapted to extremely arid conditions. Based on the paucity of collections and the current knowledge about population distribution, and habitat threat due to cattle ranching in their native distributions, both these species can be considered vulnerable and a priority for in situ conservation."
wfo-0001029558,"Solanum microphyllum is extremely variable in both leaf shape and prickliness; specimens with very small leaves and short internodes (thus more prickly) have been called S. didymacanthum. This morphology, however, occurs through the range of S. microphyllum and grades into larger leaf types. It appears that plants from more xeric habitats and those closer to the sea have smaller leaves and shorter internodes. The paired prickles are distinctive in S. microphyllum, and make it easy to distinguish from other similar solanums such as S. tetramerum, which also has small leaves and small inflorescences with few flowers. Larger-leaved specimens of S. microphyllum can also be distinguished from S. tetramerum by their narrow, long-triangular, rather than foliose, calyx lobes."
wfo-0001031886,"Solanum trizygum is superficially similar to S. conicum of the eastern Amazon, and is phylogenetically closely related to that species (Knapp & Helgason, 1997, Fig. 8). It differs from S. conicum in its more lanceolate leaflets that ate very shortly petiolate or sessile, and in its more elongate fruit. The fruit of S. trizygum also resembles that of S. savanillense, but is longer and has a more pronounced beak. Solanum trizygum is quite common locally in the cloud forests of Central America. The distribution pattern of Solanum trizygum, occurring in Central America and in the Cordillera de la Costa in Venezuela, is quite common in angiosperms (see Knapp, 1991a, b, 2002). This may be indicative of some dispersal in the past, but alternatively may support geological hypotheses linking the Cordillera de la Costa with the Pacific plate (see discussion in Knapp, 1991b). "
wfo-0001028182,"Solanum gonyrhachis is a rare species, only collected from a single locality. This sparse occurrence (sensu Rabinowitz, 1981) is common in the S. confine and S. dolosum species groups. Both S. gonyrhachis and its close relative S. dolosum have ciliate leaf apices, an unusual character in section Geminata. These species, with S. habrocaulon, are closely related to the members of the S. confine species group, but are segregated here because they are so distinctive morphologically. "
wfo-0001029295,"Solanum maestrense is known only from the type collection, made in the Sierra Maestra in the extreme SW of Cuba near Pico Turquino, the highest point on the island (2005 m), and Pico Joaquin (20 00.49’ N, 76 50.10’ W, 1530 m). The type specimen only has a single flower, and so examination of morphological details was not possible. In describing S. maestrense, Urban did not see the flower at all, so it is not detailed in the protologue. The small size of the flowers suggests S. americanum, a widespread weedy species, but the pointed anthers, tiny inflorescences and large seeds make S. maestrense quite different from S. americanum. The wiry, woody stems that appear to be scrambling are also unlike many of the members of the Morelloid clade, who tend to be more herbaceous and fleshy, but not always. The pointed anthers are like those of the similarly enigmatic S. anomalostemon from southern Peru, but that species is densely pubescent and has ternate leaves. It is possible that S. maestrense is not even a Solanum species, but the internodal, lateral inflorescences, purple flowers (fide protologue and Amshoff, 1957), poridical anthers (though peculiar) and ovoid seeds make this the most likely placement. The truncate or nearly truncate calyx is reminiscent of Lycianthes or Witheringia, but both those genera have axillary inflorescences. The flowers are the smallest known for any species of Solanum. The possession of 4-merous flowers is common in many species in both Solanum and other solanaceous genera, but has often been used to distinguish new species (e.g., Solanum cruciferum of section Geminata, see Knapp, 2002). "
wfo-0001027964,"Solanum flagellare is similar to S. reineckii in its sprawling, decumbent habit, leaf shape, and unbranched inflorescences. It is differentiated by its stems, petioles, leaves, and inflorescence axes that are stellate-pubescent with sessile or short-stalked stellate hairs with stalks up to 0.2 mm long, and calyces that are without prickles or sparsely armed with prickles. Solanum reineckii has stems, petioles, leaves, and inflorescence axes that are stellate-pubescent with sessile to long-stalked hairs, the stalks often prickle-like and up to 2 mm long, and calyces that are moderately to densely armed."
wfo-0001030807,"Solanum reineckii is most similar to S. flagellare in its decumbent habit, leaf shape, and unbranched inflorescences. It differs by its stellate-pubescent stems, petioles, leaves, and inflorescence axes with sessile to long-stalked hairs, the stalks often prickle-like and up to 2 mm long, and calyces that are moderately to densely armed with prickles. Solanum flagellare has stems, petioles, leaves, and inflorescence axes that are stellate-pubescent with sessile or short-stalked stellate hairs, the stalks up to 0.2 mm long, and calyces that are without prickles or sparsely armed with prickles. The two species are also disjunctly distributed, with Solanum reineckii occurring in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states whereas S. flagellare is restricted to São Paulo state.
"
wfo-0001031567,"Solanum subtusviolaceum is one of the glandular-pubescent species from the Andes without accrescent calyces. It is morphologically most similar to S. juninense, with which it shares shallowly toothed leaves, long (to 2 mm long) glandular trichomes and corollas with a dark central eye. Solanum subtusviolaceum has longer, more narrowly triangular (2.5–3.5 mm long versus 1.5–2 mm long) calyx lobes and more stone cells per berry (4 versus 1–2) than S. juninense, and the inflorescences are usually unbranched (rather than consistently forked) although some specimens of S. subtusviolaceum have some forked inflorescences. Solanum juninense has a more northerly distribution in Peru than S. subtusviolaceum, which occurs from central Peru to northern Bolivia. Leaves of S. subtusviolaceum are often tinged with purple beneath and usually more truncate at the base than those of S. juninense. In S. subtusviolaceum, the corolla eye is markedly dark in dry material, although this can also be the case in some specimens of S. juninense. Solanum subtusviolaceum differs from the lower elevation glandular-pubescent S. arenicola in its larger flowers (1.5–2 cm in diameter versus 0.8–1.2 cm in diameter), its more deeply divided calyx and the slightly larger (0.7–0.8 cm in diameter versus 0.3–0.7 cm in diameter) with fewer (ca. 20 versus 35–45) seeds."
wfo-0001027864,"Solanum esuriale is often completely without prickles, but sometimes bears numerous short prickles on the stems, rarely extending to the calyx. These prickly forms appear to be randomly distributed geographically and have no taxonomic significance. According to Symon (1981), S. esuriale is a variable species. Prickly and without prickles plants occur. In Victoria, slender plants with smaller rounded leaves known as S. pulchellum are found and in Queensland coarser plants with lower leaves shallowly lobed (var. sublobatum of Domin) occur. However, vigorous plants often show some lobing on their lower leaves (which are usually absent in herbarium specimens), and these do not warrant taxonomic status. Berries are usually globular or ovoid, but some may have an acute apex, and these occur amongst globular forms and show no particular patterns of distribution. Flowers are usually five-partite, but four-partite flowers may be found. The fruits were eaten by the Aborigines and are also a measurable component in the diet of emus.  Symon quotes the type citation for S. esuriale Lindl. as follows: “April 19, 1836, We overtook the party where it had crossed some extensive plains. . . . (almost opposite the entry of Willandra Billabong into the Lachlan and somewhat east of Hillston). . . . . where we observed a species of Solanum the berries of which our native guides gathered and ate”. J. Richardson was the collector of some plants. The sheet of CGE consists of two complete plants one of which bears the label “Interior of New Holland, S. esuriale m. Apples eaten by the natives of the Lachlan. Major Mitchell’s Expedition 1836, 24 March (25)”. The isotype at Kew is simply labelled “Interior of New Holland, Solanum esuriale Lindl., Major Mitchell’s Expedition 1838”. Bean (2004) considers this species to be closely related to the New World S. elaeagnifolium. He states that the species are so similar that microscopic examination is often necessary to determine them. Solanum elaeagnifolium differs by the branchlet stellae 0.4-0.5 mm diameter (vs. 0.7-0.9 mm for S. esuriale) with 15-18 lateral rays (8-12 lateral rays for S. esuriale), prickles usually present on pedicels and calyx (absent for S. esuriale), calyx stellae with 13-20 lateral rays (vs. 6-9 for S. esuriale) and anthers 7-9 mm long (vs. 3.5-5 mm for S. esuriale). Despite these similarities, molecular evidence shows that S. elaeagnifolium is not closely related to S. esuriale (Bohs et al., unpub. data). Conservation status: Widespread. Not considered at risk."
wfo-0001031402,"Solanum stenopterum differs from S. lacunarium by the more sparsely distributed, longer and more acicular prickles; smaller leaf lobing index (sometimes entire); stellae very sparse to moderate on lower leaf surface (vs. very dense for S. lacunarium); stellae consistently with 3-5 lateral rays on upper leaf surface (vs. 7-10 lateral rays for S. lacunarium); central ray relatively long; inflorescences comprising 1-3 flowers and common peduncle usually absent (vs. 5-7 flowers, common peduncle 26-46 mm long for S. lacunarium). In S. stenopterum, the style extends further beyond the anthers than in most other species. It very rarely sets fruit (pers. obs.; I. Menkins pers. comm.). Only 2 fruits are present in the collections at BRI, and both of these are insect damaged. Etymology: From the Greek stenos meaning ‘narrow’ and pteron meaning ‘wing’. This is in reference to the proximal extension of the leaf lamina resulting in a winged petiole."
wfo-0001027719,"Solanum dumicola is related to S. furfuraceum, but differs by its small size; the thin non-descript bark, the more frequent prickles on the branchlets; the broader adult leaves; the sparse stellate indumentum and absence of finger hairs on the upper leaf surface; the reduced 1-3 flowered inflorescence; the smaller stellae on the calyx; and the longer fruiting pedicels. Conservation status: Solanum dumicola has been recorded from 4 locations, and is currently known from 2 locations. It is threatened by clearing of regrowth forest. Applying the IUCN guidelines (IUCN, 2001), a category of “Vulnerable” is recommended (VU B2ab(iii)). One population is within the Expedition National Park. Etymology: The epithet is from the Latin, and means “dweller in thickets”, a reference to the usual habitat."
wfo-0001027768,"Solanum elachophyllum can be distinguished from all other Queensland Solanum species by the very small leaves (5-11 x 3-7 mm). It is apparently related to S. esuriale and S. sturtianum by virtue of its stellate hair morphology (Bean, 2004). It would probably make an interesting horticultural subject as a pot or tub plant. "
wfo-0001027067,"According to Symon (1981), S. cinereum does not appear to be closely related to other Australian species except perhaps S. brownii. It differs from them all in its shallowly campanulate flowers and the dark parchment-like globe of the dry berry. It does not appear to be related to the northwestern Australian species with dark seeds, nor to the adjacent S. campanulatum, from the eastern ranges of New South Wales. Bean (2001), however, placed S. cinereum into the S. brownii group, which in his concept includes 10 species from southeastern mainland Australia. Members of this group have deeply lobed juvenile leaves and unlobed to deeply lobed adult leaves with the abaxial surfaces densely white to yellow canescent with stellate pubescence. The plants are andromonoecious and the fruits are pale green to whitish green, often with darker streaks or lobes. Evidence that S. cinereum was an early introduction into South Australia is convincing (Symon, 1976) and is based on the collection records. The plant is relatively large, is conspicuous in flower and fruit and is not likely to have been overlooked by the early collectors. Only two collections have been found that were made before 1900 and both of these are in the vicinity of Port Augusta. In 1921 it was collected at Quorn but has not been collected further north. Between 1900 and 1960 it spread and consolidated its occurrence further south in the hilly country west of Wilmington and Melrose and in the Port Germein Gorge. As the Gorge and Mt. Remarkable are localities often visited it would indeed be remarkable if the plant had been overlooked until 1922. In 1967 it was collected further south near Crystal Brook and in 1966 much further south near Lochiel. The species was probably introduced with animals or fodder during the extensive stocking of the Flinders Ranges in the early years of settlement of the State. The species is considered weedy in New South Wales as ‘Narrawa Bur’ and was once listed amongst the twenty worst weeds of that State (Maiden, 1915, 1917). However it was low on his list then and subsequent experience has shown it to be of minor importance. "
wfo-0001027242,"Solanum corifolium is a variable species. It is found in the wet sclerophyll and rain forest of the east coast. Variants occur in these habitats and the plants may be erect, sprawling or prostrate, almost without prickles or very prickly, the flowers white or blue. When lower branches contact the ground, they often root at the tips. Solanum corifolium is closely related to S. discolor, but differs by the branchlet stellae only 0.15-0.25 mm across (0.25-0.4 mm for S. discolor), central ray of branchlet stellae lacking (0.2-0.8 times as long as laterals for S. discolor), all flowers bisexual (some flowers male for S. discolor), corolla 8-10 mm radius (3-7 mm for S. discolor), anthers 4-5.5 mm long (2.5-4 mm long for S. discolor), ovary with very short, gland-tipped hairs (glabrous for S. discolor), and the mostly smaller fruits."
wfo-0001027740,"Solanum echegarayi is a fleshy, almost succulent plant with deep woody rhizomes from which new shoots arise every growing season. It is a member of the Episarcophyllum clade together with S. riojense and S. sinuatirecurvum, but not related to S. caesium which has previously been thought to have affinities to these taxa. All species of the Episarcophyllum clade are perennial herbs with woody underground rhizomes and occur in dry habitats in Argentina and neighbouring Chile, generally above 2,000 m elevation. The species all have slightly thick and fleshy leaves that appear succulent when compared to other species of the Morelloid clade. Solanum echegarayi and S. riojense have long been confused due to a mix-up of type specimens. Solanum echegarayi differs from S. riojense in its lack of cobwebby, tangled trichomes and in its sharply pointed rather than rounded calyx lobe apices. Solanum sinuatirecurvum also has cobwebby trichomes and differs from S. echegarayi in its much larger berries (more than 1 cm in diameter versus usually less than 1 cm in diameter) with a yellow, leathery pericarp rather than a green to greenish purple, somewhat translucent pericarp."
wfo-0001028476,"Solanum huaylasense is a member of a clade containing S. chilense, S. corneliomulleri, and S. peruvianum s.str. (+ in some analyses S. habrochaites). It is most similar to S. chilense, from which it differs in its less pubescent (green) leaves and slightly smaller flowers. The two species share the elongate peduncle and bifid inflorescence. Populations from Río Fortaleza (high up in the Callejón de Huaylas) are slightly more pubescent than the others, and have curved buds and recurved calyx lobe tips in fruit. Solanum huaylasense grows in rocky cliff faces near the type locality (B. León, pers. comm.) and is generally a straggling, lanky plant in the wild. Solanum huaylasense was previously considered part of the broadly defined S. peruvianum s.l. The table lists all the TGRC accessions (LA numbers) previously included in Rick’s broad definition of S. peruvianum with their current identification. Solanum huaylasense is a priority for conservation due to its narrow range, the paucity of collections and lack of knowledge about population status. Cultivated specimens of Solanum huaylasense are robust and erect plants during initial growth and later decumbent, with highly dissected leaves, very long peduncles, inflorescences typically two-branched but often three-branched. Stems, internodes, leaves, inflorescences, flowers, and fruits are usually larger in cultivation than in the wild, but maintain similar character proportions to those collected in the wild."
wfo-0001027808,"Two collectors have independently stated that the mature fruit colour is orange. Solanum eminens differs significantly from S. hamulosum by the adult leaves that have 5-7 pairs of conspicuous acute lobes, and with 40-120 prickles on the upper leaf surface (leaves entire, 0-10 prickles for S. hamulosum); the very sparse to sparse indumentum of the upper leaf surface (moderate to dense indumentum for S. hamulosum); the stellae of the lower leaf surface 0.25-0.35 mm diameter with central ray 0.3-0.6 times as long as laterals (0.4-0.5 mm diameter and central ray 0.7-1.5 times as long as laterals for S. hamulosum) and the orange mature fruit (green for S. hamulosum). Etymology: From the Latin, eminens meaning “projecting, high”. This is in reference to the altitude at which this species grows (1500-1600 metres), the highest for any Australian Solanum. "
wfo-0001029226,"Like the other temperate zone species in the Dulcamaroid clade (S. dulcamara, S. pittosporifolium), S. lyratum is widely distributed, somewhat weedy and grows in many different habitats. It is sympatric with and very similar to S. pittosporifolium; the species can be differentiated by leaf pubescence. Solanum lyratum always has long glandular trichomes on all vegetative parts, especially the new growth, while S. pittosporifolium is glabrous or has very short uniseriate trichomes on the leaves and young stems. Leaf shape in S. lyratum is extremely variable; most specimens have lyrate leaf bases and ternate leaves with a very large central lobe (see Figure 2 in Knapp 2013), but simple leaves are common and some specimens (e.g., Licent 2286, the type of S. septemlobum var. indutum) have pinnatifid leaves with 5-7 pairs of leaflets. Pubescence, however, is very consistent and is an excellent diagnostic character for S. lyratum. Flower color also varies from dark purple to white, but there are always green spots at the base of the corolla lobes. Although most Solanum species have bright yellow anthers, S. lyratum occasionally has blackish purple anthers; it is not clear whether this is genetic or is due to an environmental effect. Anthers in S. lyratum are never tapered like those of S. dulcamara; due to pubescence differences these two species are not difficult to distinguish (but see S. pittosporifolium).
"
wfo-0001030452,"The fruit and seeds are reminiscent of those of S. capsicoides All., which occurs in similar coastal habitats but further north along the Brazilian coast; otherwise these two species are not particularly close."
wfo-0001020050,"Capsicum coccineum has been placed in the Bolivian clade, although such placement is only moderately supported. The relationships of C. coccineum should be analysed in depth, especially with regard to its phenotypic variability (see below) and wide geographic distribution. This shrubby species is the only one in the genus with a notable scrambling vine habit; its very fragile branches are supported on the trunks of other trees or shrubs. This habit, along with the inflorescence, with nearly 18 flowers on a short rachis, the short, strongly ridged pedicels, the corky scars of the pedicels, the small corollas and the reflexed fruiting calyx, are the most diagnostic characters for this species. Two morphs of C. coccineum can be distinguished, based on the number of calyx appendages. The first morph, which includes the type collection, has a calyx with 10 unequal appendages or 2–10 appendages; the second morph has a calyx lacking appendages. Populations from Bolivia generally have calyx appendages, while populations from Peru and Brazil exhibit both morphs. Further fieldwork throughout the range of C. coccineum is needed to elucidate if the variability observed in the calyx morphology is an intraspecific variation or if a cryptic species is involved. Similarly, corolla colour is also variable in this species and deserves more attention in the field. Some collector labels mention a uniform corolla colour (yellow, cream, brilliant greenish-yellow), while others indicate dull yellow corollas with yellowish-green spots within or with purple-brown or violet centre. Variations in corolla colour and degree of development of the calyx appendages are observed in other species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, for example, C. schottianum. In Bolivia, C. coccineum is sympatric with C. minutiflorum and C. baccatum var. baccatum. All three of these entities share red globose pungent fruits on erect pedicels. Capsicum coccineum differs from C. minutiflorum in its scrambling vine habit vs. erect shrubby habit, multi-flowered inflorescence (up to 18 flowers) vs. few-flowered inflorescence (up to five flowers) and calyx appendages absent or 2–10 vs. usually five appendages. Capsicum baccatum var. baccatum differs from C. coccineum in the same set of contrasting characters and in its corolla colour that is white (vs. yellow or cream) and the dimorphic styles (vs. homomorphic styles). The fruits of C. baccatum var. baccatum can also be ellipsoid."
wfo-0001030730,"Solanum quadriloculatum is closely related to S. ellipticum, but differs by the conspicuously ridged branchlets, the presence of long-stalked stellae (stalks > 0.4 mm long and up to 1.6 mm long) on all plant parts, the mostly larger stellae on the upper and lower leaf surfaces, the 9-15 flowered inflorescences (1-9 flowered for S. ellipticum), the flimsy (non-rigid) prickles on the calyx, and the absence of prickles on the rachis of the inflorescence. Solanum quadriloculatum fruits are consistently 4-locular, but some forms of S. ellipticum may also be 4-locular. Solanum crassitomentosum is related to S. quadriloculatum, but differs by the 1-2 flowered inflorescence (9-15 flowered for S. quadriloculatum), calyx and leaf laminae without prickles (leaves and calyx prickly for S. quadriloculatum), inner surface of corolla densely stellate hairy (vs. glabrous for S. quadriloculatum), central ray of stellae on lower leaf surface 1.5-2 times as long as lateral rays (vs. 0.8-1.2 times for S. quadriloculatum) and the brown to black seeds (vs. pale yellow for S. quadriloculatum). The type of S. quadriloculatum was collected from the Nicholson River at about 18o latitude. All subsequent collections of S. quadriloculatum have been made further south (19-22.5o latitude). "
wfo-0001026227,"The affinities of this species are not known with any certainty, and it is only tentatively placed in the S. ellipticum group. Symon (1981) considered S. angustum to be a synonym of S. parvifolium and stated: “The type specimen consists of three leafy portions, one with a fruit attached and a second detached fruit present. From the photograph, the plant is obviously closely related to S. parvifolium R. Br. and to a lesser extent S. ferocissimum Lindl. The type locality of S. angustum is at the northern extremity of the distribution of S. parvifolium. The berry of S. angustum was described as 1.5 cm diam., which is larger than usual for S. parvifolium. However, the seeds of S. angustum, which have been examined, are very similar to those of the two related species. I therefore prefer to consider S. angustum Domin as an extreme form of S. parvifolium until further specimens are collected.” "
wfo-0001032445,"Solanum virginianum, despite its name, is an exclusively Eastern Hemisphere species, and occurs from northern Africa to southern China in ruderal areas in tropical or subtropical climates. The name was not in common use until Hepper and Jaeger (1986) showed that it was conspecific with what had previously been called either S. surattense Burm.f. or S. xanthocarpum Schrad. & J.C.Wendl. in local floras. It is a distinctive taxon, with a prostrate habit, extremely prickly stems and leaves, and bright purple, intensely fragrant flowers. The combination of these characters together with the shiny lobed leaves with yellowish green prickles make identification straightforward. It could be confused with some of the prickly taxa from eastern Africa such as S. adoense and S. macracanthum, but its distribution coupled with the habit, shiny leaves and fruiting pedicels strongly deflexed towards the ground. It is a common plant of waste areas, and can form large colonies in open places. 
"
wfo-0001030300,"Solanum pennellii, with its compound leaves with almost orbicular leaflets and anther cones (tubes) with lateral hairs connecting the anthers but without a sterile apical appendage, is easy to distinguish from all other tomato relatives. Carrizo García (2003) recognized S. pennellii in the genus Solanum, and the other species of sect. Lycopersicon in the genus Lycopersicon due to this anther difference. In contrast, D'Arcy (1972) placed S. pennellii in Lycopersicon. The spathulate calyx lobes and slightly zygomorphic flowers are also unique (in the tomatoes) in S. pennellii. Despite these distinctive characteristics, specimens of S. pennellii can be confused with S. corneliomulleri, especially when sterile or in fruit. Solanum pennellii never has the long glandular trichomes characteristic of S. corneliomulleri, but instead has shorter, stickier pubescence. Pubescence morphs in S. pennellii have been described as subspecific taxa, but the differences are not consistent either geographically or in terms of habitat, suggesting the trait is of little taxonomic importance. Interestingly, in more pubescent individuals of S. pennellii, this increase in pubescence extends to the anthers (interlocking papillae) and may be of interest in further investigations of anther morphology in the groups (see Glover et al. 2004). Solanum pennellii is an important component of the lomas vegetation of the west coast of South America in the desert regions, but also occurs in dry valleys along the western Andean slope. Blooming times of populations in the lomas and in other habitats appear to differ, with lomas populations blooming in September to November, coinciding with the foggy season on the Peruvian coast. One TGRC accession of S. pennellii (LA716) from near Atico in the Department of Arequipa in southern Peru (vouchered by Correll & Smith P-173) has been of importance in the development segmented introgression lines with the S. lycopersicum cultivar M82 (see Eshed & Zamir 1994, 1995). Each of the 76 IL lines contains a single introgressed segment of the S. pennellii genome giving complete coverage of the genome. This resource has been critical to the understanding of yield parameters (Eshed et al. 1996; Fridman et al. 2004) and leaf dissection (Holtan & Hake 2003)."
wfo-0001026874,"Solanum caricaefolium is most similar to S. saponaceum Dunal, but that species is more robust and somewhat larger in most measurements. The two can be separated as in the following key: 1. Leaves not markedly fleshy, thinner-textured when dry; inflorescence 2-several-branched, 2-6 cm long in flower; peduncles obsolete to 1 cm long; corolla 2-3 cm in diameter, white; berries 6-9 mm in diameter; seeds relatively few, ca. 50 per berry, 2-2.5 mm long; 200-1000 m, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil. S. caricaefolium 1a. Leaves somewhat fleshy, becoming thicker-textured when dry; inflorescence 2-7-branched, 5-12 cm long in flower, the peduncle 1.5-4 cm long; corolla 3-4.5 cm in diameter, showy lavender to violet, rarely white; berries 10-15 mm in diameter; seeds numerous, 1.8-2.3 mm long; 1400-3200 m, Peru. S. saponaceum The specific epithet is not to be corrected to “caricifolia” since the leaves are compared to those of Carica in the Caricaceae, not those of Carex in the Cyperaceae. Solanum caricaefolium reaches the southern end of its range along with the limit of the lowland evergreen forest in the region of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. Here it is sympatric in a small area with the northern limit of the range of S. consimile C. V. Morton, a purple-flowered species mainly of the semi-arid mountains and inter-Andean valleys from northwestern Argentina to central Bolivia. Hybrid populations have been noted, but probable hybrids are difficult to detect in herbarium material, especially in specimens with only fruits. A third species of sect. Torva with a similar habit and almost identical bright orange fruits is Solanum acutilobum Dunal (syn. S. myrianthum Rusby, S. fieldingii Dunal). It commonly occurs with these two species in their area of sympatry, but S. acutilobum does not seem to hybridize with the other two."
wfo-0001032304,"Solanum velutissimum is characterized by long-stalked echinoid hairs on young stems, peduncles, pedicels, petioles, and lower leaf surfaces; the hairs on the upper leaf surfaces are short and thick-stalked. It can also be distinguished from the closely related S. riparium by the broader calyx lobes, more elliptic leaves, less appressed tomentum on lower leaf surfaces, longer hairs on stems and peduncles, and flower buds that are usually larger at anthesis."
wfo-0001030336,"Solanum peruvianum is a member of the clade containing S. corneliomulleri, S. chilense and S. huaylasense (+ in some analyses S. habrochaites). It is distinguished from its close relatives by the character combination of uniform, dense, velvety pubescence with only scattered short glandular hairs (in contrast to the longer glandular hairs of S. corneliomulleri), usually strongly bracteate inflorescence and curved anther tube. The peduncle in S. peruvianum usually is equal or shorter than the length of the inflorescence branches, and is consistently shorter than that of S. chilense and S. huaylasense. There is considerable variation in leaf morphology in populations of S. peruvianum along the Peruvian coast. More northerly populations around Lima and the Department of Ancash have leaflets that are crenate to deeply lobed to 1/4 of the way to the rachis and inflorescences that are sometimes almost ebracteate. The other populations of S. peruvianum from the southern part of the species range (e.g. Lomas de Atico, Department of Arequipa) have nearly entire leaflets and very large inflorescence bracts. Solanum peruvianum is a low elevation coastal species, characteristic of the lomas vegetation (see Ecology and Natural History above). The table lists all the TGRC accessions (LA numbers) previously included in Rick’s broad definition of S. peruvianum with their current identification. Solanum peruvianum was one of the first wild tomatoes to be cultivated in European botanical gardens. Original introductions appear to have come from at least two different parts of the species range. The type specimen of S. peruvianum in the Linnaean herbarium (LINN, see http://www.linnean.org) and plants grown by Philip Miller in the Chelsea Physic Garden in the early 18th century match plants from the area around Lima, Peru, while many continental botanical gardens such as Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg (e.g. Sprengel’s Solanum commutatum) had plants whose morphology is more similar to that of plants collected in more southern Peruvian populations. "
wfo-0001026299,"Solanum arcanum is a member of a clade containing S. neorickii and S. chmielewskii, and is sister to them. It can be distinguished from them by its generally more finely crenate leaflets (leaflets of the other two species usually have more widely spaced crenations), larger inflorescences with more flowers and the more complex mix of trichome types. Solanum arcanum and S. neorickii are sympatric in northern Peru with, but they can easily be distinguished as S. arcanum has much larger corollas (1.8-2 cm in diameter vs. 1-1.2 cm in diameter) and more flowers per inflorescence (10 vs. 7). Accessions we now recognize as S. arcanum did not cross successfully with either S. chmielewskii or S. neorickii (Rick et al. 1976), leading Rick to believe that they were not closely related. We do not feel crossability is a reliable indicator of relationship in the tomatoes and their relatives. Solanum arcanum is an extremely variable species, comprising of four weakly defined morphotypes (“assemblages”) with discrete geographic ranges. The complex overlapping variability, especially in leaf morphology, dissuades us from recognizing these as formal taxa. The table lists all the TGRC accessions (LA numbers) previously included in Rick’s broad definition of S. peruvianum with their current identification; the assemblages of S. arcanum to which individual accessions belong are also indicated. A. ‘Marañón’ Assemblage. Robust erect plants, sometimes to 1 m tall, decumbent when mature; little to no velvety pubescence, with dense long patent trichomes, leaflets dentate or more deeply incised; growing in the Río Marañón Valley (includes the type of Solanum arcanum, Hutchison et al. 5449). This includes the Chamaya-Cuvita and the Marañón assemblage of races that Rick (1986 a) recognized as closely related based on their interfertility in experimental crosses. B. ‘Humifusum’ Assemblage. Slender prostrate plants; pubescence velvety; leaflets entire or with only a few marginal teeth, velvety pubescent on the abaxial side, and dark green; inflorescence unbranched; growing in Pacific drainages. The type of Lycopersicon peruvianum var. humifusum (Blood & Tremelling 42) comes from among these populations. C. ‘Chotano’ Assemblage. Slender prostrate plants; almost completely glabrous; lateral leaflets deeply lobed; growing in the Río Chota Valley near Yamaluc in the Department of Cajamarca (e.g., Sanchez Vega 2291). The ‘humifusum’ and ‘Chotano’ assemblages appear to be closely related based both on interfertility(Rick 1986a), and molecular sequence data (Peralta & Spooner 2001), and differ mainly in pubescence. D. ‘Lomas’ Assemblage. Slender prostrate to semi-erect plants; pubescence velvety; leaflets dentate or almost entire; inflorescences simple or sometimes branched; growing at the Lomas of Cerro Campana and Virú (e.g., Dillon et al. 2703). These populations are incredibly variable from year to year; specimens collected in El Niño years have very large leaves, while those collected in drier seasons have smaller, more pubescent leaves with fewer leaflets and less lobed margins. The ‘Lomas’ populations are quite variable in morphological characters, such as inflorescence branching pattern, and appear morphologically somewhat like southern populations of S. peruvianum s.s. A list of TGRC accessions previously identified as L. peruvianum s.l. but now recognized as S. arcanum can be found in Peralta et al. (2005). Because these northern populations could be crossed successfully with S. chilense but not with S. peruvianum s.s., Rick (1986a) suggested that they were ancestral to the rest of the “peruvianum complex,” and that northern Peru was a major site of evolutionary development in the wild tomatoes. . Specimens of S. arcanum grown in cultivation tend be vigorous plants, with larger stems, internodes, leaves, inflorescences, flowers, and fruits than specimens collected from the wild, but they maintain similar characters found in wild specimens collected in similar geographic areas, and the cultivated accessions generally can also be assigned to the four assemblages mentioned above."
wfo-0001027244,"Solanum corneliomulleri is a very distinctive species, with its strongly curved anther tube and copious glandular pubescence interspersed with very long uniseriate trichomes that are usually gland-tipped. Rick (1986a) included it in his broadly defined S. peruvianum (as Lycopersicon peruvianum), based on its ability to interbreed with S. peruvianum s.s. and S. arcanum as defined here. The table lists all the TGRC accessions (LA numbers) previously included in Rick’s broad definition of S. peruvianum with their current identification according to this monograph. Populations of S. corneliomulleri from the region of Volcán Misti (Yura and Tingo) in the Department of Arequipa (e.g. Schmidt s.n., F) are distinct in having narrower leaflets, shorter pubescence and extremely long calyx lobes in fruit that enclose the berry like a cage. Our AFLP analyses (Spooner et al. 2005) suggest that S. corneliomulleri and S. peruvianum are hybridizing in the southern part of Peru, especially in the coastal parts of the Department of Arequipa. The two taxa do not form two monophyletic clades in the AFLP analysis although morphologically easily distinguishable which suggests genetic exchange in this region. This genetic mixing is perhaps due to the migration of people and animals from the Peruvian highlands to the coast during the wetter parts of the year, when highland farmers bring animals to the lomas for grazing which may potentially disperse the fruits and seeds (B. León, personal communication). This practice is especially common in the wet valleys of Pisco (Dept. Ica) and Nazca (Dept. Nazca) where cultivation of crops is extensive and adventive seeds may become established. A single specimen of S. corneliomulleri from Puerto Pizarro, Department of Tumbes (Cerrate 4956, USM) is anomalous in being very far north from the rest of the species range and right on the coast. This specimen is a good match for others collected in populations near Matucana (Department of Lima, ca. 1500 m elevation) region and we suspect it is mislabeled. Solanum corneliomulleri has never been collected north of Lima and we have seen no other specimens approaching this morphology from the Department of Tumbes."

wfo-0001031690,"Although the species resembles Solanum citrullifolium, it can be distinguished by its rhizomatous, perennial habit and by the structure of the fruit, which is slightly open at the apex and with the pedicel longer, the calyx less prickly, the berry smaller and the seeds larger than in S. citrullifolium. In addition the flavonoid chemistry of S. teniuipes is more complex. Two geographical races are recognised as varieties (by Whalen, 1979)."
wfo-0001027091,"The central Texas plants of Solanum citrullifolium (var. citrullifolium) are somwehat different from those of W Texas and Coahuila state, Mexico. The most distal leaf lobes are usually more rounded, the stellae are often absent from the leaf undersides and the inflorescences longer in fruitng stages. Var. citrullifolium has only been collected twice since 1930, and the last time in 1949. Three geographical races are recognised as here as varieties."
wfo-0001026259,"Solanum antisuyo is morphologically most similar to S. polytrichostylum with which it has been conflated in the past. It can be distinguished by its usually simple inflorescences where pedicels are spaced ca. 1–3 mm apart along the short flowering-bearing portion of the axis compared to consistently branched inflorescences with the flowers congested at the branch tips in S. polytrichostylum; bud morphology also differs with the buds of S. polytrichostylum always somewhat elongate and usually cream with purple stripes, while those of S. antisuyo are more ellipsoid and usually of a single colour. The fruits of S. antisuyo are somewhat ellipsoid and borne on pedicels that markedly enlarge towards the apex as compared to the spherical berries on less obviously expanded pedicels of S. polytrichostylum. The the seeds also differ in colour (brown in S. antisuyo versus yellow in S. polytrichostylum). Solanum antisuyo has the calyx tube longer than the smaller, purple-tinged calyx lobes while S. polytrichostylum has calyx tubes shorter than the slightly larger, triangular calyx lobes; the styles of S. polytrichostylum are always more exserted (2–4 mm versus 1–2 mm beyond the anther cone) than those of S. antisuyo; fruiting pedicels of S. antisuyo persist after fruit drop (see Fig. 22D), while those of S. polytrichostylum generally do not. The two species are also ecologically somewhat distinct, with S. polytrichostylum restricted to streams and moist roadsides, and S. antisuyo is found in drier areas in gravel, disturbed areas, and landslides. Other sympatric members of the Morelloid clade without glandular trichomes with which S. antisuyo could be confused include S. cochabambense that has smaller, spherical fruits, larger violet corollas that are more rotate in outline, and denser indumentum with longer 3–7-celled simple hairs, and S. pallidum that has branched rather than simple hairs.
"
wfo-0001028723,"Solanum ivohibe is a slender forest shrub with almost glabrous leaves on decurrent long petioles, prominent domatia on leaf undersides (Fig. 13 inset), inflorescences with a long peduncle and 10-16 flowers. It seems likely that S. ivohibe can grow as a liana. The very few collections suggest it grows along streams in mid-elevation mesic to wet secondary forests in the underexplored and exceptionally diverse area around Andrigitra National Park (Lewis et al. 1996). Within Madagascar S. ivohibe is most similar to S. sambiranense, and to some extent also with S. imamense and S. betroka. Solanum ivohibe can be distinguished from S. sambiranense by its inflorescence bearing 10-16 (versus 3-10) flowers, calyx lobes 0.8-2 mm long tearing for up to 1mm (versus calyx lobes 4-6 mm long tearing for up to 2 mm), and minute versus larger tufts of trichomes (domatia) in the axils of the veins and midrib of the lower leaf surfaces; it also occurs further south than the distribution range of S. sambiranense. Solanum ivohibe is sympatric with S. imamense and S. betroka; it differs from these two species by its long-decurrent (versus cuneate) leaf bases, larger leaves (> 5 cm long versus shorter than 5 cm), smaller calyx, and calyx lobes <2 mm long (versus usually > 2 mm long). D'Arcy and Rakotozafy (1994) considered S. ivohibe to be a relative of the Mayotte endemic S. macrothyrsum but with smaller leaves and inflorescences; it shares features with both S. macrothyrsum and S. sambiranense. The anthers of S. ivohibe are longer than those S. macrothyrsum (3.5-4 mm versus 2.5-3 mm), the calyx lobes are somewhat longer (0.8-2 mm versus under 0.5 mm) and more deeply divided. Solanum ivohibe appears to occupy a somewhat higher elevation, higher moisture, and more closed canopy environment than the similar species S. betroka in the arid south, S. sambiranense in fairly dry north-west, and S. imamense in mesic niches, and the distribution range of S. ivohibe does not overlap with these species. Solanum ivohibe apprears to be sympatric with S. madagascariense around Andringitra National Park and the surrounding forests although S. madagascariense occurs in wetter forest. "
wfo-0001029606,"Solanum moense is known only from the type, a scrappy specimen in fruit, and very few other recent collections. It is very similar morphologically to S. pachyneurum, with coriaceous entire leaves, but differs from that species in its larger fruit and more reddish rusty pubescence of long-stalked, rather than sessile, trichomes. The narrowly acicular calyx lobes are like those of S. gundlachii, but the smaller flowers, entire leaves and bright reddish rusty pubescence serve to distinguish S. moense from that species."
wfo-0001025812,"Solanum albescens is an unusual species in the Morelloid clade with large, campanulate corollas and a woody creeping habit. Solanum albescens is morphologically similar to S. leptocaulon, sharing with it a decumbent habit, high elevation distribution and campanulate flowers. The species differ in leaf texture (those of S. albescens are much more leathery/coriaceous than those of S. leptocaulon), pubescence (S. albescens has curling trichomes confined to the stems or only on leaf margins, while the leaves of S. leptocaulon are often pubescent on the lamina and the trichomes are stiff and usually antrorse) and flower size (1.5–2 cm long in S. albescens and 1–1.2 cm long in S. leptocaulon). Although the anthers of both species are similar in size (2.5–3 mm long) the relative size of the anthers is strikingly smaller in S. albescens due to the much larger corolla. The tips of the calyx lobes in S. albescens appear to be fleshy and somewhat swollen but this needs confirmation with field examination."
wfo-0001026377,"Solanum athenae is morphologically very similar to S. felinum, a species of the Cordillera de la Costa of Venezuela. Solanum athenae differs in having a long linear apex to the calyx lobes, which are deltoid or lanceolate in S. felinum, deeply stellate purple corolla (stelliform, white in S. felinum), prickle bases ca. 1 mm wide (to 4 mm in S. felinum). Solanum athenae is based upon a single collection. This striking species appears to belong to sect. Lasiocarpa comprising 13 species monographed by Whalen et al. (1981). The section as defined by Whalen et al. (1981) is centred in northern South America with two outlying species, S. repandum in the Central Pacific and S. lasiocarpum in S.E. Asia extending from southern and eastern India to New Guinea. Phytogeographically this is an intriguing distribution. The re-evaluation of Asian species such as S. ferox, S. barbisetum and S. preatermissum is a priority for establishing the relationships and distribution of this group. Solanum athenae was named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athena who sprang fully armed from the brow of Zeus and who later carried his arms and is an oblique reference to the very strongly armed nature of the species. The epithet was originally published as “atheniae”, correctable to “athenae” following Article 60 of the ICBN (McNeill et al., 2006)."
wfo-0001032277,"Solanum validinervium is a tightly branched shrub of windswept páramo regions, and is quite common where it occurs. The inflorescences are not strictly leaf-opposed, but the species belongs in section Geminata. Its closest relative is S. vacciniiflorum of montane Costa Rica. Solanum validinervium differs from that species in its plurifoliate sympodial units, long petioles, short, broad corolla lobes, and translucent yellow fruit. The spicy odor of the flowers of S. validinervium is unusual in the section; very few of the other species have any flower odor (however see S. lucens of the S. arboreum species group and S. corumbense of the S. leucocarpon species group), and none that I have collected have such a strong smell. The smell is reminiscent of a mixture of cloves and cinnamon."
wfo-0001030796,"Morton (1976) suggested that S. reductum was related to S. delitscens C.V.Morton and to S. salicifolium Phil (as S. collectaneum C.V.Morton) and its phylogenetic position has remained ambiguous. Chiarini (2013) treated it as a provisional member of the Cyphomandra (Pachyphylla) clade in the most recent treatment of the flora of Argentina, whilte Moyetta et al. (2013) treated it as a member of the Morelloid clade. Molecular evidence has shown it to belong to an early-diverging branch in the larger Geminata clade, together with S. delitescens. Solanum salicifolium is a member of the Morelloid clade (although it was treated as a member of the Dulcamaroid clade by Knapp 2013). Solanum reductum is unusual in the Geminata clade in being a rhizomatous subshrub; large patches of plants are all connected underground, but patches are never extensive as they are in the other clearly rhizomatous species in the clade, S. argentinum Bitter & Lillo (see Knapp 2008).
"
wfo-0001030802,"Solanum refractifolium is a distinctive species with its heart-shaped leaves, sticky pubescence and campanulate flowers. It is known from very few collections and is likely to be a conservation priority. Its recollection and description from live plants is a priority."
wfo-0001030982,"Solanum sagittantherum is unusual in the Geminata clade in possessing tetramerous flowers, but other species originally described with tetramerous flowers have later been shown to have populations with pentamerous flowers as well (e.g. S. cruciferum Bitter, see Knapp, 2002), and should more populations of S. sagittantherum be found, they may indeed prove to pentamerous. Granados-Tochoy & Orozco (2006) were uncertain of the affinities of S. sagittantherum, as it combines many of the characteristics of several of the pragmatic species groups delimited by Knapp (2002). Its flattened seeds and apically enlarged fruiting pedicel make it similar to members of the Solanum leucocarpon group, while the rhizomatous habit is shared with both S. arboreum Dunal and S. robustifrons Bitter. The rhizomatous habit is unusual in the Geminata clade, and may be related to the humid nature of the habitat in which S. sagittantherum occurs. The sagittate anther bases for which the species is named are also very unusual in the Geminata clade, but are also present in S. ambylophyllum Hook.f. of central Peru, which differs from S. sagittantherum in distribution, in having plurifoliate, rather than difoliate and geminate, sympodial units and in its complex branched inflorescences."
wfo-0001022366,"We use the name Lycianthes inaequilatera provisionally here for Costa Rican and Panamanian plants in Georg Bitter's series Strigulosae (Bitter, 1919) with relatively short pedicels and short, fine trichomes that are tightly antrorsely appressed along the midvein of the abaxial side of the leaf blade. The names L. lankesteri and L. aurigera, listed above as synonyms, were published to take into account the variation described here under L. inaequilatera in Costa Rica, and more study is needed to understand the variation in these populations. The name L. inaequilatera was first used for Bolivian material that is very similar to that seen in Costa Rica and Panama (tightly appressed fine pubescence), however the type specimen of L. inaequilatera is less pubescent than the plants seen in Costa Rica and Panama. Lycianthes inaequilatera is closely related to two other Central American species, L. inconspicua Bitter and L.amatitlanensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn. Sm.) Bitter. Lycianthes inconspicua differs from L. inaequilatera in having longer pedicels (15-30 mm in flower and 30-35 mm in fruit) (Dean et al. 2020). Lycianthes inaequilatera has pedicels of similar length to those of L. amatitlanensis, but L. amatitlanensis has long spreading trichomes along the midvein on the abaxial side of the leaf (Dean et al. 2020). Where these three species overlap in their distributions, L. amatitlanensis tends to occur at lower elevations than the other two species. Intermediates between L. inaequilatera and L. amatitlanensis occur in Costa Rica and Panama, and these two species may eventually be treated as a single entity. If combined, the name L. inaequilatera is the older name.

wfo-0001022367,"Lycianthes inconspicua is a species of high elevation areas in Central America. It is closely related to three other Mexican and Central American species, L. glabripetala E. Dean, L. amatitlanensis (J.M.Coult. & Donn.Sm.) Bitter and L. inaequilatera (Rusby) Bitter (Dean et al. 2020). Lycianthes amatitlanensis differs from L. inconspicua in having shorter pedicels (4-12 mm in flower and 6-16 mm in fruit), long, coarse trichomes that spread away from the midvein on the abaxial side of the leaf (usually with some trichomes at an angle close to ninety degrees), and lanceolate anthers with a longer attenuate portion at the tip (ca. 0.5 mm long). Lycianthes inaequilatera and L. glabripetala are more similar to L. inconspicua in terms of having appressed trichomes along the leaf blade midvein, but they tend to have shorter pedicels (15 mm or less in flower); in addition, L. glabripetala has larger corollas (1-1.2 cm long) (Dean et al. 2020).

wfo-0001031483,"Solanum stipulatum is morphologically most similar to S. leptopodum of Amazonia, sharing with that species difoliate, geminate sympodial units with markedly smaller minor leaves. It is convergent with other species of section Geminata growing in river courses (see S. amnicola, S. imberbe, and S. monadelphum) but this similar leaf shape is related to habitat, not to any real indication of relationship between these species. Solanum stipulatum is an easily recognized species, with its short internodes, striking oblong-lanceolate leaves, and white bark. "
wfo-0001027123,"Solanum coalitum is a striking species with its large, fleshy bright purple flowers and black fruits. Some specimens of S. coalitum have been identified as S. stenophyllum Dunal, with which it is very similar. Solanum coalitum differs from S. stenophyllum in its subshrubby, sometimes trailing habit, its glabrous stems and leaves (except for the peculiar marginal trichome band), its cyathiform (rather than conical) calyx and its slightly larger flowers that are glabrous abaxially. Trichomes of S. coalitum when they occur are looser and more openly dendritic than the almost echinoid trichomes that are distinctly yellowish of S. stenophyllum. The fruiting pedicels of S. stenophyllum appear to be nodding when fruit are mature, while those of S. coalitum are erect. Specimens of S. stenophyllum have been collected from the province of Loja (i.e. Jørgensen et al. 477, 1068, BM) from further north and at slightly lower (2600-3000 m) elevations than S. coalitum and in drier and/or degraded forests. Solanum stenophyllum grows as a shrub or small treelet, usually in disturbed situations. Some individuals of S. stenophyllum in southern Ecuador are very sparsely pubescent, but the conical calyx and yellowish closely branched trichomes serve to distinguish these plants. Solanum coalitum would key out with S. leiophyllum, S. macbridei Hunziker (southern Peru) and S. imbaburense in the key in Knapp (1989), being distinguished from S. imbaburense by its broadly deltate, rather than long triangular calyx lobes, and its leaves with sparsely papillate undersides. "
wfo-0001031362,"Solanum spissifolium is closely related to S. pseudocapsicum, a widespread weedy species in the Neotropics. It differs from that species in its narrow, lanceolate leaves and somewhat smaller flowers, fruit, and seeds. Solanum spissifolium may be a geographical variant of S. pseudocapsicum, but since no recent collections exist and it is easily differentiated from that species I prefer to accord it species status until future in-depth studies are undertaken. "
wfo-0001027473,"Solanum delitescens is of uncertain affinities, and could be an isolated relative of the section in its broadest sense. The anther structure of the plants is peculiar (see Morton, 1976) and unlike anything else in the genus Solanum, with the narrow base being completely empty of pollen. Its relationships may be with members of section Cyphomandropsis."
wfo-0001026460,"Solanum bahianum is a species of somewhat uncertain affinities in this group. It clearly belongs in this assemblage with its unifoliate sympodia, tiny globose buds, small flowers, and filiform flowering pedicels. Solanum bahianum is unusual in the group (and in the traditional concept of section Geminata; see Knapp, 2002) in possessing floccose branched trichomes on the new growth and inflorescence axes. These trichomes are common in the S. arboreum species group, which I consider to be closely related to the unifoliatum group (see Knapp, 1986a). The combination of tiny globose buds, reflexed calyx lobes at anthesis, unifoliate sympodia, and floccose trichomes on the new growth is unique in section Geminata. Solanum bahianum is superficially similar to the sympatric S. santosii: both have small flowers and pendant fruits (Knapp, 1989b). It is not unusual to find two similar species of section Geminata growing sympatrically (Knapp, 1986a, 1986b)."
wfo-0001028468,"Solanum hovei Dunal is considered a rare species known only from a small number of collections from India. Due to its morphological similarity and sympatric distribution with two other prickly Solanum species, S. hovei is often confused in the field and in herbaria with S. torvum and S. violaceum, known historically as S. indicum (Rao, 1986). Careful examination of these collections could potentially lead to the identification of additional specimens of S. hovei that have been previously overlooked. Solanum hovei can be distinguished from S. torvum by its relatively narrow, rhombic to subelliptic leaves with acute to short-attenuate leaf bases, in contrast to S. torvum’s broad, ovate leaves with rounded to subcordate leaf bases. Additionally, S. hovei has smaller, unbranched inflorescences that bear up to ten flowers with pedicels that often recurve in fruit, while S. torvum has larger, branched inflorescences that yield a greater number of flowers with pedicels that remain erect in fruit. Deb (1979) relegated S. hovei to the synonymy of the widespread and highly variable Solanum violaceum (as S. indicum). Solanum violaceum differs from S. hovei in having recurved cauline prickles, broadly elliptic to ovate leaves, sinuate to more deeply lobed leaf margins, rounded to subcordate leaf bases, and erect fruiting pedicels. In contrast, S. hovei has predominantly straight cauline prickles, rhombic to subelliptic leaves, shallowly triangular-lobed leaf margins, acute to short-attenuate leaf bases, and often recurved fruiting pedicels. Specimens of S. hovei from the Eastern Ghats cited by Rao (1986) may be S. violaceum, a related and much more widespread species. Historically Solanum hovei has also been likened to an unrelated tropical American species, S. carolinense, with which it lacks geographic overlap but shares some morphological resemblance in leaf shape and prickly growth form (Sen Gupta, 1964). The two species differ, however, in that S. hovei has unbranched inflorescences and flowers with smaller calyx lobes and corollas, shorter anthers, and a pubescent style. "
wfo-0001031394,"From the few collections available, it is difficult to establish the significance of the variation in corolla color. The purple color of the corolla easily fades and a single branch may have both a purple flower and one that has faded to white. The stamens are more variable in length than is usual in Solanum. Whether this is due to differences among populations or whether it is the result of differences in stamen length between fertile and sterile flowers of the same plant cannot be decided until living plants can be examined. According to the ininerary of Pohl’s travels in Brazil in volume 1 of the Flora Brasiliensis, Pohl did not collect in the state of São Paulo where the type is said to be from. He did spend much time in east central Minas Gerais near Minas Novas, which is north of Serra da Penha and the type is probably from this region."
wfo-0001030609,"Solanum pseudogracile is a species of the eastern North American coastal plain, and usually occurs in coastal areas not far from the sea. It is very similar to the adventive S. chenopodioides and can be very difficult to distinguish from it. Solanum pseudogracile has longer rectangular to obovate calyx lobes that are rounded to acute at the apex and reflexed in fruit, while S. chenopodioides has short triangular calyx lobes that are acute at the apex and always appressed in fruit. In addition, S. pseudogracile has a longer style that extends (1)2.0–2.5 mm beyond the anther cone, compared to S. chenopodioides where the style is exserted only to 1.5 mm beyond the anther cone. The species differs from S. nigrescens in lacking stone cells or rarely having 2, while S. nigrescens always has 4–13 stone cells per fruit. In the absence of fruit these two species can be very difficult to distinguish; they are widely sympatric along the Gulf Coast of the southern United States of America."
wfo-0001026308,"Solanum arequipense is morphologically very similar to S. furcatum of central Chile and adjacent Andean Argentina and has been previously confused with that species. The species share forked inflorescences, globose buds with styles that are often exserted prior to anthesis, and greenish purple mature fruits. Solanum arequipense differs from S. furcatum in having no or only two apical stone cells in the fruits, while S. furcatum has more than six that are easily seen though the pericarp. DNA sequence data the two species are not closely related; they may share different parentage. Solanum pentlandii also has similar globose buds and exserted styles but has much shorter anthers (less than 2 mm versus 2.5–3 mm in S. arequipense) and shiny green berries that lack stone cells. Plants of S. arequipense are generally woodier than those of S. pentlandii and occur at lower elevations. The two species are sympatric in central Peru, where S. arequipense has been collected at high elevations. Leaf lobing is usually more pronounced in S. pentlandii, but this is not consistent across the species range."
wfo-0001030991,"Solanum salicifolium extremely variable in leaf shape, ranging from simple and linear (the type of S. salicifolium) to deeply pinnatifid (the type of S. tenuisectum). This is the extreme of similar variation in leaf shape found throughout the clade, and has led to confusion over the identity nd synonymy of this species. Like S. endoadenium and S. angustifidum, also of the eastern Andean slopes in Argentina, S. salicifolium is a shrubby species, but it never appears to become vining. Solanum salicifolium is distinguished from S. endoadenium by it eglandular, appressed, ascending pubescence of simple trichomes with slightly bulbous bases and its usually simple inflorescences with the flowers clustered near the tip. It differs from S. angustifidum in its leaves that are lanceolate, rather than elliptic, in outline, its simple inflorescences and its anthers borne on equal filaments. The pinnatifid leaves of S. salicifolium are somewhat morphologically similar to those of members of the Radicans clade (S. corymbosum, S. palitans, S. radicans andS. tripartitum). These taxa have pedicels that are flush with the inflorescence axis, rather than inserted into a small sleeve, and the flowers are spaced along the inflorescence axis rather than being clustered at the tip on a small platform. The flowers of S. salicifolium are much larger than those of members of the Radicans clade, with anthers 3–5.5 mm long versus 1–2 mm long."
wfo-0001027584,"Solanum dimorphandrum differs from both S. monarchostemon and S. thelopodium in its larger, apparently fleshier flowers and in its ellipsoidal berries. Like S. thelopodium, the leaves are glabrous or with only papillate trichomes, this species never possesses long, uniseriate trichomes like those of S. monarchostemon. Solanum dimorphandrum tends to grow at higher elevations than either S. monarchostemon or S. thelopodium, and is found to the N and W of the Andes rather than being strictly Amazonian. Specimens of Solanum dimorphandrum form the basis for the report of S. anceps Ruiz & Pav. (section Pteroidea, the Solanum mite species group) from Panama (D’Arcy, 1974). Solanum anceps is a similar, simple-leaved herb or small wand-like shrub, but has axillary inflorescences, actinomorphic flowers and verrucose berries."
wfo-0001021024,"Averett (1973) recognized C. villosa and C. crenata as distinct species, but acknowledged that they were closely related. I agreed with Averett’s assessment early on, but additional collections and fieldwork in Mexico suggest the overlap of the two is considerable and difficult to distinguish. Indeed, collections from Mpio. Parras, Coahuila, the type area of C. crenata, are as “villose,” or more so, than C. villosa itself. In short, I now believe that the recognition of a single, highly variable, robust species is the preferred treatment. This assessment agrees with that of Henrickson (2009) who combined C. villosa and C. crenata, taking up the former name for the “inclusive species,” for reasons unspecified, both published at the same time. In my opinion the proper name for the duo, if synonymized, should be C. crenata, its author publishing C. villosa as an afterthought, or footnote to the former, this on the same page. Averett (2010a), however, retained both taxa. After reviewing again their taxonomic history, he summed up the matter, as follows: “since the two taxa are distinct in and around their type localities and in all but a few populations in Trans-Pecos, Texas, I believe the continued recognition of C. crenata and C. villosa is warranted.” This logic I follow not, for the types concerned are quite similar in southern Coahuila, Mexico, although most collections from Mpio. Parras (from whence the type of C. crenata) are more densely villous than those of the reputed C. villosa."
wfo-0001029056,"Solanum leucandrum is thought to have arisen by divergence of an isolated, peripheral population of S.greyi, to which it is closely related. If it should expand its range and become sympatric with S. greyi (ca. 100 km), it would be mechanically isolated from that species by its much smaller flowers. Other traits that distinguish S. leucandrum from S. greyi are its scattered cauline stellae, its less dissected leaves with stellate hairs on the upper surface, its corolla lacking the black central star chracteristic of S. greyi and its unique, often white lower (and larger) anther.
"
wfo-0001026233,"Solanum annuum is a distinctive species; it is small annual herb with leaves that are extremely variable in shape even on the same plant. The inflorescence is long and filiform, and the calyx is a spreading cup, somewhat like those of S. weddellii and S. gilioides. Unlike those taxa, however, the calyx does not become accrescent and fully envelop the fruit but remains an expanded plate-like structure subtending the tiny berry,"
wfo-0001032502,"Solanum weddellii is morphologically very similar to S. gilioides and it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish them from fragmentary herbarium specimens. The most striking differences are in calyx shape through anthesis and fruit development. In flower, the calyx lobes of S. gilioides are linear or narrowly triangular and grow considerably in length when fruiting (Fig. 62G, H), while those of S. weddellii are more ovate-deltate and expand in width in fruit, forming a broadly open, somewhat frilly-looking cup (Fig. 182D). Leaves of S. weddellii are more densely pubescent and usually less deeply divided than those of S. gilioides and flowers are smaller (ca. 0.6 cm in diameter with anthers ca. 1 mm long in S. weddellii versus ca. 1.6 cm in diameter with anthers 1-3 mm long in S. gilioides)."
wfo-0001029373,"Solanum mariae can be easily distinguished from other section Basarthrum species based on the large, broadly ovate and spreading calyx lobes in flower that become to enclose the entire fruit that are not known from any other species of the section. Further distinguishing characters include the combination of trailing stems that root along nodes, the relatively dense pubescence of long, 2-4-cellular glandular-tipped finger hairs throughout the plant, and the strictly simple leaves. In Peru, the species is most similar to S. caripense Dunal and closely allied species, but differs in having simple leaves combined with the glandular-tipped finger hairs throughout mature plants and larger calyx lobes that are spreading in flower and are accrescent and enclose the fruit. Anderson and Bernardello (1991) provide a key to the members of series Caripensia Correll to which the new species clearly belongs based on morphology. Based on the style extension well beyond anthers in the newly described species, S. mariae is likely to be self-incompatible. Style extension has been found to indicate self-incompatibility in sect. Basarthrum in previous studies (e.g., Anderson 1979). The trailing growth form of the new species, where roots are formed at leaf nodes, has been observed in other members of sect. Basarthrum, as well as in the closely related sect. Anarrhichomenum Bitter (Tepe et al. 2012), whose members are distinguished from those of sect. Basarthrum by the presence of pseudostipules, winged seeds, and fruits maturing red or orange. The central Andes region is a centre of diversity for Solanum sect. Basarthrum (Stern et al. 2008; Anderson 1979; Anderson et al. 2006; Särkinen et al. in prep.), and the new species described here adds to the growing list. Solanum mariae remains poorly understood based on our two collections from the single known population from the San Marcos Province of the Department of Cajamarca. No further specimens have been seen in local herbaria in Trujillo and Cajamarca. The locality lies within the watershed of the Río Marañón, and further field work in the same watershed in the Province of San Marcos is a priority in order to increase knowledge of this rare species, including the morphology of the fully mature fruits.
"
wfo-0001027030,"Solanum chmielewskii is sister to S. neorickii, and is difficult to distinguish from that species in the absence of flowers. Both species are related to S. arcanum, from northern Peru, rather than to S. lycopersicum and the other red-fruited species as was suggested by Rick et al. (1976). The flowers of S. chmielewskii are about twice the size of those of S. neorickii and the stigma is always exserted from the anther cone. The corolla tube tends to be slightly larger in diameter, with a more pentagonal corolla outline. Both species have uniform, short whitish pubescence, and small green fruits. Rick et al. (1976) suggested that the outcrossing S. chmielewskii gave rise to the autogamous S. neorickii in their area of sympatry in southern Peru (Dept. Apurimac), near the type localities for both species. Crosses between the two species usually resulted in low seed set (Rick et al. 1976), suggesting they have developed reproductive isolation, at least in their area of sympatry. Hybrids obtained were intermediate in size between the two parents. Solanum chmielewskii prefers drier, better-drained habitats than S. neorickii (Rick et al. 1976) and is found at somewhat higher elevations. The only Bolivian collection is from the Sorata Valley (Mandon 392) which is drier than other yungas valleys in Bolivia, and is the southern limit for other Solanaceae of dry habitats, such as Nicotiana glutinosa L."
wfo-0001029784,"Solanum neorickii is sister to S. chmielewskii and, in the absence of flowers, difficult to distinguish from it (see above and the key for distinguishing features). In general S. neorickii has smaller inflorescences and is a somewhat less robust plant than S. chmielewskii. Solanum neorickii is autogamous and self-pollinating, which perhaps accounts for its much broader distribution compared to S. chmielewskii (throughout the inter-Andean valleys from southern Ecuador to southern Peru as opposed to southern Peru and adjacent northern Bolivia). Rick et al. (1976) suggested that S. neorickii was an example of “speciation via the simple device of autogamy”, although they did not observe pollination or reproduction in the wild. The species is remarkably uniform genotypically throughout its range in Peru and all allelic diversity in S. neorickii is also found in S. chmielewskii (Rick et al. 1976). "
wfo-0001030628,"Within Solanum section Crinitum, Solanum pseudosycophanta most closely resembles Solanum sycophanta Dunal. The distribution of these taxa overlaps in Peru and Ecuador; however, Solanum sycophanta is more widespread throughout the Andes, while Solanum pseudosycophanta is restricted to northern Peru and southern Ecuador. These two species have large (4-8 cm) elliptical to round, glabrous fruits, more or less spiny trunks, and predominantly entire leaves at maturity. Solanum pseudosycophanta differs from Solanum sycophanta in having prominent long-stalked stellate hairs on the stem, inflorescence, and adaxial surface of the leaf. In Solanum sycophanta the stems and petioles lack long-stalked stellate hairs, and are glabrous or pubescent with sessile to short-stalked multangulate hairs. The calyx also differs between these two taxa; Solanum pseudosycophanta has calyx lobes with acute apices that cover most of the corolla in bud, while Solanum sycophanta has a calyx with shorter truncate calyx lobes that only partially cover the petals in bud. Furthermore, Solanum pseudosycophanta in fruit has a knobby calyx with thick pointed lobes, whereas Solanum sycophanta has a smaller rounded calyx without the pointed lobes.
"
wfo-0001027365,"Within section Crinitum, S. cyathophorum most closely resembles S. altissimum Benítez and S. kioniotrichum Bitter ex J. F. Macbr. Solanum altissimum is distributed throughout the western Amazon Basin from Colombia and Venezuela to Peru and western Brazil. Solanum kioniotrichum is endemic to Departmento Loreto, Peru. All three species have small round glabrous fruits (1-2 cm) and predominantly entire leaves. Solanum cyathophorum differs from S. altissimum and S. kioniotrichum in having a calyx with truncate lobes that do not completely cover the corolla in bud, thus exposing the end of the corolla. In S. altissimum and S. kioniotrichum the calyx lobes are acute to obtuse and completely cover the corolla in bud, only splitting later to expose the corolla. The adaxial leaf surfaces of S. cyathophorum are either completely glabrous or sparsely pubescent with hairs having a multiseriate stalk and 1-2 horizontal apical ray cells. Specimens of S. altissimum have similiar hairs on the adaxial leaf surface, but may include hairs which are stellate or reduced to rounded knobs. Solanum kioniotrichum can be easily distinguished from both S. altissimum and S. cyathophorum by the pronounced basal cells of the adaxial leaf hairs.
"
wfo-0001025741,"Within Solanum section Crinitum, S. adenobasis most closely resembles S. acanthodes Hook.f., S. grandiflorum Ruiz & Pav. and S. vanheurckii. The distribution of the former three taxa overlaps in Peru and Ecuador; however, S. grandiflorum is more widespread throughout the Andes and S. acanthodes is distributed throughout the western Amazon Basin, while S. adenobasis is restricted to northern Peru and southern Ecuador. Solanum vanheurckii is distributed throughout the central and eastern Amazon Basin. All four species have large (4-7 cm) round glabrous fruits, more or less spiny trunks, and predominantly shallowly lobed leaves. Solanum adenobasis differs from S. acanthodes and S. grandiflorum in having tiny but prominent glandular hairs at the base of the long-stalked stellate hairs found on the stem and adaxial surface of the petiole. These glandular hairs were found to be present on one of the syntype collections of S. vanheurckii but are absent from nearly all other collections reviewed under that species. In S. grandiflorum and S. acanthodes the stems and petioles lack the long-stalked stellate hairs. Furthermore, S. grandiflorum has a closely appressed tan stellate tomentum covering most surfaces including the calyx, while S. adenobasis, S. vanheurckii and S. acanthodes have a calyx that is covered with long-stalked stellate hairs well-separated from one another, leaving the calyx surface visible.
"
wfo-0001030686,"Solanum punctulatum is very distinct from any other Solanum on Jamaica. It is unusual in the genus in being a large, forest canopy tree, and is endemic to the montane rainforests of the Blue Mountains. It could be confused with S. schlechtendalianum Walp. of Cuba and mainland tropical America, but differs from that species in its more golden, lepidote trichomes and its purple (rather than white) flowers. The markedly bifid style of S. punctulatum is also very distinctive and unusual. Individual specimens of S. punctulatum appear to be either all long-styled and bearing fruit or all short-styled, perhaps indicating that the species is another dioecious member of Solanum (see Knapp et al., 1998). This urgently needs to be checked in the field. The very narrow range of S. punctulatum and the conversion of the lower slopes of the montane rainforests of Jamaica for coffee cultivation in the 19th century, suggest that the species could be of some conservation concern, although the establishment of the Blue Mountain and John Crow Mountain National Park in 1992 will go a long way to protecting this endemic species."
wfo-0001032352,"Solanum verticillatum was considered a montane form of S. evonymoides by Knapp (2008); field collections in 2013 confirmed the distinctness of this species. Solanum evonymoides is known from coastal forests in Bahia and adjacent Espirito Santo, and eastern Minas Gerais and although morphologically similar to S. verticillatum is distinct in both habitat and in several morphological features. Solanum verticillatum differs from S. evonymoides in its tree habit, branches that appear verticillate due to short internodes, smaller sweet-smelling flowers (<2 cm in diameter), shiny chartaceous leaves, and orange berries. Solanum verticillatum also resembles S. psilophyllum (another set of specimens previously recognised as S. evonymoides by Knapp 2008) in its glabrous shiny leaves. It differs from that species in its more broadly deltate calyx lobes, its distinctly pedunculate inflorescences (versus inflorescences that branch only very near the base in S. psilophyllum), its berry that is orange or yellow-orange when ripe, and in its flattened rather than ovoid seeds. These two species can be very difficult to distinguish, but the marked constriction just below the calyx lobes at the distal end of the swollen pedicel occurs only in S. psilophyllum. This species was commonly collected until approximately the 1980s and populations from the Paranapiacaba reserve are well represented in SP. It is strange that more recent collections do not seem to have been made; this may be due to the tree habit of S. verticillatum and to its similarity to the more common species S. campaniforme and S. pseudoquina A.St.Hil. It can be distinguished from S. campaniforme by its shiny, completely glabrous leaves (the leaves of S. campaniforme have tufts of trichomes in the vein axils abaxially) and from S. pseudoquina by its equal anthers (those of S. pseudoquina are markedly unequal). It differs from both species in its yellow or orange berries and pseudoverticillate branching. Most specimens of S. verticillatum at SP were previously identified as S. pseudoquina.
"
wfo-0001030636," Solanum psilophyllum has a very narrow distribution restricted to the Iron quadrangle, within areas that are today active mines, and to the Serra do Cipó region, were it was collected more than ten years ago, in forest fragments close to roadsides. The fact that no collections are known from northern areas of the Espinhao range likely indicates that the distribution is extremely restricted to the region acround Serra do Cipó and the Iron Quadrangle. Efforts to locate new populations of this species are urgent, especially considering that most areas where it might occur are currently owned by mining companies and are subject to an intensive land use. Solanum psilophyllum is also morphologically similar to S. lacteum Vell. from Atlantic forests in Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais states. It differs from that species in its larger flowers (>1 cm in diameter), longer inflorescences, elliptic rather than obelliptic leaves that do not dry a blackish brown colour and in the non-lenticellate stem. Like S. lacteum, S. psilophyllum is completely glabrous. Solanum psilophyllum has an underground stem, like S. arboreum Dunal of northern South America and Central America (see Knapp 2002); this characteristic may be more common in the Geminata clade than currently thought, as it is rare that the underground parts of these small shrubs are collected or even observed.
"
wfo-0001030146,"Solanum oxapampense is a very distinctive species with its coriaceous and strongly discolorous leaves, with the upper surfaces dark green and shiny and the veins deeply impressed, and the lower surfaces densely pubescent with pale tan peltate trichomes. It is similar to Solanum verecundum M. Nee with which it is broadly sympatric, but does not apparently co-occur. Solanum verecundum is found along the eastern slopes of the Andes from Ecuador to southern Peru, Solanum oxapampense is possibly derived from it. The two species share trichomes that are peltate to some degree, small white flowers and small fruits (orange in Solanum verecundum, apparently green at maturity in Solanum oxapampense). Solanum oxapampense differs from Solanum verecundum in its coriaceous, narrower leaves and in its pubescence, which is composed of truly peltate trichomes whose rays are fused for more than half their length and that lack midpoints. Trichomes of Solanum verecundum have rays that are only fused in the central half, near the midpoint; midpoints are always present, even if sometimes very small and nub-like.
"
wfo-0001030153,"Solanum pabstii is a very striking species, with its large, open, many branched inflorescences of relatively large, white flowers. The inflorescence axes of S. pabstii are extremely thin and filiform, and are brittle on herbarium specimens. Specimens of S. pabstii have been misidentified as S. pseudoquina A. St. Hil, another species of the Geminata clade (a member of the S. nudum species group of Knapp, 2002) occurring in southern Brazil. The two species share filiform inflorescence axes (although the inflorescences of S. pabstii are much more branched) and leaves that dry pale green on the herbarium sheet. They differ in flower morphology, with S. pabstii having all anthers of equal size and dehiscence of pores lengthening to slits with age, and S. pseudoquina having markedly unequal anthers that dehisce by tiny pores that never lengthen to slits. Solanum pseudoquina has tufts of uniseriate trichomes in the vein axils on the abaxial leaf surfaces, while S. pabstii has small resinous patches on the new growth in the veins axils that develop into cavities with resinous margins in mature leaves. The cavities are probably domatia (sensu O’Dowd & Willosn, 1991) and are a distinctive feature of the species, found nowhere else in the Geminata clade, and to my knowledge nowhere else in Solanum. Not all mature leaves develop the cavities to their full extent, but at least some leaves on every specimen examined had them. The ecological function and development of these cavities will be an interesting study in plant-insect interaction, should they be found to house mites. Although the seeds of S. pabstii are not known at present, I suspect they will be flattened reniform with enlarged margins. Solanum pabstii conforms to other characters of the S. nudum species group, but as yet has not been included in phylogenetic analyses. "
wfo-0001030872,"Solanum ripense has only been collected a few times but I found it locally abundant near La Carbonera, Edo. Mérida, Venezuela. It grows in cloud forest, often in dense tangled stands in old treefalls. The trees do not flower profusely; this may be the reason for the paucity of collections of this species. Solanum ripense is most similar and probably most closely related to S. tanysepalum, from which it differs in its shorter, fleshier calyx, longer inflorescences, and larger stature. The bark of S. ripense is distinctive in its blackish color and warty texture; this is apparent even on young twigs. This character is the only one useful in identifying sterile specimens of these two species, the leaves of S. ripense and S. tanysepalum being nearly identical in shape and texture. In the Flora del Avila (Steyermark & Huber, 1978), individuals of S. tanysepalum were identified as S. ripense. This is perhaps not surprising, as so few collections of true S. ripense exist and the two species are very similar vegetatively. Solanum ripense does not occur in the coastal Cordillera of Venezuela. A label on the isotype specimen in MPU indicates that Solanum ripense was established in cultivation in Luxembourg from Linden’s collection in the mid-nineteenth century. I have seen no other indication that the species was cultivated or passed on to any other European botanic garden."
wfo-0001030161,"Solanum pachyneurum is a distinctive plant, with its thick, hard leaves with a prominent marginal vein and striking yellowish venation beneath. The trichomes of stems and leaves are very small (to 0.5 mm in diameter), and have rays that are fused for sometimes up to half their length, making them appear lepidote. In dry specimens the trichomes of the new growth are somewhat reddish. "
wfo-0001025729,"Solanum acuminatum is closely related to S. nudum but has larger flowers and longer pedicels in fruit than the latter species. The plants have a distinctive appearance, both in life and on the herbarium sheet. The new growth is usually deep purple, and the leaves are quite shiny on the upper surfaces. The inflorescences remain on the stems after the fruits drop, and a shoot will often have several pseudoterminal inflorescences with the continuing growth from several generations overtopping the dry inflorescence axes on the lower stem. The leaves usually dry dark in color, and the trichomes in the vein axils of the abaxial leaf surfaces are quite variable in density and are often branched. Near Unduavi in the Department of La Paz, Bolivia, a pubescent form of Solanum acuminatum occurs. This has been called S. pearcei, but although more densely pubescent on the abaxial laminae, these plants agree with the type of S. acuminatum in all other respects."
wfo-0001026756,"Solanum callianthum is unusual (with S. quebradense) in the S. nigricans species group in its possesion of loose, rather than arachnoid trichomes. It shares fleshy flowers and erect fruting pedicels with the other members of the S. nigricans species group. Three collections from eastern Ecuador were provisionally placed in Solanum callianthum by Knapp (2002), although their pubescence is composed of largely simple, uniseriate trichomes rather than the more typical dendritic trichomes found in Colombian material: Ecuador. Napo: Salcedo-Napo road, km 55 Río Tena, 2995 m, 4 Feb 1977, Boeke 892 (BM, NY); SE of El Palyón de San Francisco on slopes of Cerro Mirador, 3300-3700 m, 0 35’N, 77 38’W, 28 Dec 1980, Holm-Nielsen et al. 29804 (AAU, BM). Morona Santiago: km 22-27 of Cuenca-Gualaceo-Sigsig-Chiguinda road, 3050-3280 m, 3 09’S, 78 39’W, 12 Jul 1995, Alvarez & Tirado 1503 (BM, MO, QCNE). All these plants whoever, do have at least some dendritic trichoems, it seems that the proportion of simple to dendritic trichomes in Ecuadorian populations is different to those from further north. These specimens share rugose leaves, loose pubescence, unifoliate sympodia, and fleshy flowers with the more typical Colombian specimens. Further studies of these plants in the field and good fruiting collections from the Ecuadorian populations may help to clarify their relationships.  A single collection from southern Peru (Cusco: prov. Urubamba, Machupicchu, 88-112 km from Cusco, along Inca trail, 2060-4150 m, 13 09’10'S, 72 31’00'W, 14-22 Oct 1987, Núñez & Arque 8325 (NY)) may also belong here, but the specimen has apparently been collected from a very immature plant and is only in young bud."
wfo-0001022233,"Lycianthes banahaensis is a small tree with shiny geminate leaves and prominently lenticellate stems and fruiting pedicels. The leaves are extremely variable in size; this has led to the description of the entity several times from different localities in the Philippines (see synonymy), as has variation in pubescence density on new growth. Lycianthes anisophylla, for example, was distinguished from L. lagunense in being “more glabrous” (Elmer 1915). Lycianthes banahaensis is most similar to L. bimensis of the Sunda Islands; both species are trees with fleshy, heterostylous flowers, dense fine pubescence on the new growth and orange or bright red mature berries. The prominently lenticellate stems and pale bark of L. banahaensis are diagnostic; L. bimensis has smooth stems and dark brown bark. Lycianthes banahaensis has smaller flowers (corolla 0.8–1 cm in diameter versus 1.4–1.6 cm in diameter in L. bimensis) with the style of pistillate flowers held within the anther cone and strongly lobed (versus exserted and long-clavate in L. bimensis). Both species occur on the island of Flores (West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia)."
wfo-0001022263,"Lycianthes bimensis is a distinctive plant with long-petiolate leaves with prominent and crowded principal veins. The flowers are heterostylous, and I have not seen berries or developing berries on specimens with short-styled flowers, suggesting L. bimensis is dioecious. The calyx of L. bimensis has 5 small appendages borne somewhat below a hyaline rim; it can be distinguished from other species with 5 calyx appendages such as L. laevis in its tree habit, fleshy corolla lobes (versus membranous lobes) and heterostylous flowers. The calyx tube in L. bimensis is usually larger (3–3.5 mm versus 1.5–2.5 mm) and more robust than that of L. laevis. Lycianthes bimensis is most similar to L. banahaensis, both species are trees with fleshy, heterostylous flowers, dense fine pubescence on the new growth, 5 calyx appendages and orange or bright red mature berries. Lycianthes bimensis has smooth stems and dark brown bark versus the diagnostic prominently lenticellate stems and pale bark of L. banahaensis. Leaf petioles in L. bimensis are generally longer relative to leaf size than in L. banahaensis, and the flowers of L. bimensis are larger (corolla 1.4–1.6 cm in diameter versus 0.8–1 cm in diameter in L. banahaensis). The style of long-styled flowers of L. bimensis is exserted from the anther cone and long-clavate whereas that of L. banahaensis has the style of long-styled flowers contained within the anther cone and strongly lobed. Both species occur on the island of Flores (West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia)."
wfo-0001032536,"Solanum wrightii is very commonly planted as a shade or street tree throughout tropical Africa, but apparently has not naturalized widely. Some specimens from Tanzania (e.g., Mhoro 5694, MO; Kanywa 30, EA) indicate the plants were found in forest, so perhaps this species is in the process of becoming naturalized. On the other hand, these long-lived trees may be remnants of previous plantings. It is native only to a very narrow region of eastern Bolivia (F. Farruggia, pers. comm.), and it is not known how it came to be introduced to the Eastern Hemisphere. Solanum wrightii is not easily confused with other species in Africa; its tree habit and large leaves are distinctive. When non-reproductive, it can be confused with the less commonly cultivated S. chrysotrichum, but that species has more rusty pubescence and stellate rather than simple trichomes on upper leaf surfaces. In flower the two species are not confusable, S. chrysotrichum has smaller, stellate, white flowers. The large purple flowers of S. wrightii are similar to those of S. richardii, but S. richardii is a smaller, often scandent, plant that never becomes tree-like and has abundant recurved prickles on the stems and leaves.
"
wfo-0001027186,"Solanum compressum is somewhat similar to S. pabstii L.B. Smith & Downs, also of SE Brazil, but the dendritic pubescence, larger flowers and more robust inflorescences easily distinguish it from that species. The trichomes and ovoid seeds of S. compressum are like those of members of the S. arenarium species group (sensu Knapp, 2002), particularly S. gnaphalocarpon Vell. (Brazil). Solanum gnaphalocarpon has difoliate, geminate sympodia that are anisophyllous, a simple inflorescence and a distinctive densely long-pubescent fruit. The seed morphology of S. compressum needs further examination, those I have examined are from what may be immature fruits. Solanum compressum is very variable in pubescence density throughout its range, with some plants being nearly glabrous and others densely pubescent on all parts. The trichomes are always dendritic, with a long uniseriate stalk and very short branches. The abaxial surface of the anthers of S. compressum is papillate in herbarium specimens and somewhat reminiscent of the anther margins of wild tomatoes (Carrizo Garcia, 2003; Peralta et al., in press). Whether this is merely an artefact of drying is not known, but it occurs in all flowering specimens I have examined. "
wfo-0001028180,"Solanum goniocaulon is a species of uncertain relationships in the S. arboreum species group. The flowers of S. goniocaulon, like the buds (on Evinger 461), are similar to those of S. anisophyllum, another member of the S. arboreum species group from the eastern Andean slope in Peru and Ecuador. The strongly four-winged stem and the distinctive yellow color of the undersides of dried leaves make S. goniocaulon readily differentiated from any other species of section Geminata. Solanum goniocaulon is superficially similar to S. laurifrons of the S. amblophyllum species group in its angled stems and leaves drying golden yellow beneath, but differs from that species in its ovoid-reniform seeds and difoliate, geminate sympodial units."
wfo-0001022328,"Lycianthes furcatistellata is a common species in upper elevation habitats in Costa Rica, as well as parts of Panama, that is distinguished by relatively long pedicels, large, glabrous corollas with abundant interpetalar tissue, equal but free stamens, and leaves that usually have an abundance of simple trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface, even though branched trichomes are more common elsewhere on the plant.
"
wfo-0001030684,"In general habit and vegetative morphology, Solanum pumilum is somewhat similar to S. carolinense, but can be differentiated by its small stature (up to 0.2 m vs. up to 1.2 m in S. carolinense), its smaller (2.2-8.6x1.1-5.1 cm) obovate to elliptic leaf blades (vs. larger [2-15x2-10] ovate, lanceolate, or elliptic leaf blades), its inflorescence with 2-4 flowers (vs. 2-12), and its strictly white corollas (vs. blue to white). The leaf margins of S. pumilum are most often entire to sinuate, but can be shallowly lobed, and while S. carolinense also can have an entire to shallowly lobed margins, they are usually moderately to deeply lobed. Ecological traits differing between S. pumilum and S. carolinense include flowers that are sweetly fragrant (vs. usually odorless in S. carolinense [Allison and Stevens 2001]), small populations with well spaced individuals (compared to the invasive habit and dense colonies of S. carolinense), and the restricted distribution on undisturbed dolomite and amphibolite substrates (vs. disturbed substrates and waste areas).
"
wfo-0001026325,"In habit and reproductive characters, Solanum aridum resembles S. juvenale, and some intermediate forms can be found where the two species' ranges overlap (Morton 1976; Chiarini 2007). However, S. aridum can be separated from S. juvenale by the absence or very sparse density of prickles on the stem, petioles, leaf blades, inflorescence axes, pedicels, and calyces, whereas S. juvenale is typically moderately to densely armed with prickles, particularly on the calyces. The prickles on the leaf blades are usually much shorter in S. aridum (up to 3 mm long), while in S. juvenale they are up to 8 mm long. Solanum aridum also has larger leaf blades (2-10x1-5 cm) that are usually sinuate to shallowly lobed, compared to smaller leaf blades in S. juvenale (1.8-5.5x1-2.5 cm) that are more deeply lobed. The ploidy level consistently differs between the two species, with Solanum aridum being 2n = 24 and S. juvenale being 2n = 48. Experimental studies in the greenhouse by Chiarini (2007) showed that crosses between S. aridum and S. juvenale produced triploid plants (2n = 36) and that ca. 90% of reciprocal crosses between the two species resulted in offspring that produced fruit with an expected amount of seeds, yet only ca. 7% of seeds were viable. Solanum aridum was also shown to be self-incompatible."
wfo-0001027583,"In overall habit and floral and fruit morphology, S. dimidiatum is similar to S. perplexum, but it differs by the indumentum on the stems, petioles, leaves, and inflorescence axes [whitish stellate hairs with (4-)6-10 lateral rays, the central ray 1-celled and equal to or shorter than the lateral rays in S. dimidiatum vs. golden stellate hairs with (4-)6-8 lateral rays, the central ray 1-2-celled and longer than the lateral rays in S. perplexum]. It also differs by its smaller prickles on the stems and leaves (up to 6.5 mm vs. up to 15 mm in S. perplexum) and its smaller leaves (up to 16x10 cm vs. 22x18 cm). Solanum dimidiatum is also somewhat similar to S. carolinense, but can be differentiated by its larger corollas that are up to 4.6 cm in diameter (vs. corollas up to 3 cm in diameter in S. carolinense), its inflorescence that is branched once to several times (vs. unbranched or branched once), and its hard, somewhat dry fruit (vs. a softer, mucilaginous fruit)."
wfo-0001030325,"Many herbarium specimens have been annotated by W. G. D'Arcy as Solanum perplexum, but he placed the species in synonymy under S. dimidiatum in his treatment of Solanum in Florida (D'Arcy 1974). Examination of both S. perplexum and S. dimidiatum for this revision revealed several consistent, non-overlapping morphological differences between the two species, as well as separate geographical ranges (Fig. 7), and we consider S. perplexum to be worthy of taxonomic recognition at the rank of species. In floral and fruit morphology, S. perplexum is similar to S. dimidiatum, but it differs by the indumentum of golden stellate hairs with (4-)6-8 lateral rays with the central ray 1-2-celled and longer than lateral rays (vs. whitish stellate hairs with (4-)6-10 lateral rays with the central ray 1-celled and equal to or shorter than lateral rays in S. dimidiatum), the larger prickles on the stems and leaves (up to 15 mm long vs. up to 6.5 mm long), and the larger leaves (up to 22x18 cm vs. up to 16x10 cm).
"
wfo-0001026883,"Two varieties of Solanum carolinense are recognised, distinguised in the following key:
1a. Leaf margins subentire, sinuate, or lobed; sinuses of lobes, when present, reaching less than half the distance to the midvein; apex of leaf lobes subacute to acute, sometimes rounded -> Solanum carolinense var. carolinense 1b. Leaf margins deeply lobed to parted; sinuses of lobes reaching more than half the distance to the midvein or almost to the midvein; apex of leaf lobes typically rounded -> Solanum carolinense var. floridanum

Solanum carolinense var. carolinense is similar to both S. dimidiatum and S. perplexum based on habit and overall morphology, but it can be separated by its unbranched or rarely once-branched inflorescence (compared to a 1- to several-branched inflorescence in the other two species). It is further distinguished from S. dimidiatum by its light brown stellate hairs with 4-5(-6) lateral rays and the central ray 1(-2)-celled and longer than the lateral rays (compared to white stellate hairs with (4-)6-10 lateral rays and the central ray 1-celled and equal to or shorter than lateral rays). Solanum carolinense var. carolinense is separated from S. perplexum by its shorter prickles on the stems and leaves (up to 6.5 mm vs. up to 15 mm in S. perplexum), its smaller leaves (up to 15 x10 cm vs. up to 22x18 cm), and its smaller corollas (up to 3 cm in diameter vs. up to 4.6 cm in diameter).

Solanum carolinense var. carolinense exhibits several attributes that make it a highly competitive and invasive weed: it colonizes early successional or disturbed habitats, produces many seeds per fruit, grows rapidly, reproduces vegetatively, resists mechanical methods of control, has generalized pollinators, and can grow in a variety of biotic and abiotic conditions (e.g., Kolar and Lodge 2001). These same characteristics that contribute to the invasiveness of S. carolinense var. carolinense also make it difficult to control. Human disturbance such as plowing serve to open up new habitat for its dispersal and establishment. It is capable of producing ca. 40-170 seeds per fruit, with a single plant producing up to ca. 5,000 seeds that may be dispersed by birds and mammals (Martin et al. 1951; Gunn and Gaffney 1974; Solomon and McNaughton 1979; Cipollini and Levey 1997).
As with other weedy species, Solanum carolinense var. carolinense is pollinated by a variety of generalist insects. The flowers are odorless and without nectar, and provide pollen as a reward (Solomon 1987). In North America, the species has been observed to be buzz pollinated by a variety of non-specialist bees, including sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), bumblebees (Bombus spp.) carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.), and mining bees (Andrena spp.; Hardin et al. 1972; Quesada-Aguilar et al. 2008).

In its native range and in many introduced areas, Solanum carolinense var. carolinense is extremely difficult to control once established. The magnitude of the economic impact to agriculture is difficult to estimate, but given its wide distribution in the United States and locations abroad, the costs associated with control of the species, crop losses, contaminated harvests and fodder, and reduced availability of pastureland are potentially enormous (e.g., Follak and Strauss 2010). In North America, some crop yields have been decreased up to 60% by the its presence, and the quality of pastures can be severely diminished (Gorrell et al. 1981; Hackett et al. 1987; Pimentel et al. 2000). Control of the species using mechanical methods or single herbicide applications is usually not effective (Ilnicki et al. 1962; Nichols et al. 1992). Plants that are mowed during the first half of the growing season re-emerge vigorously, and tilling causes vegetative reproduction from root fragments, which often increases the severity of the infestation (Furrer and Fertig 1960; Takematsu et al. 1979; Gorrell et al. 1981; Wehtje et al. 1987). Intensive herbicide applications with certain mixtures and treatments are somewhat effective (e.g., Whaley and Vangessel 2002; Armel et al. 2003; Beeler et al. 2004), but the use of biological control agents carries considerable risk given the relatively close phylogenetic relationship to other solanaceous crops such as tomato, potato, and eggplant (Nichols et al. 1992).

In addition to being an aggressive agricultural pest, Solanum carolinense var. carolinense is a host to many insects, fungi, and viruses that can cause damage to a variety of crops, especially solanaceous ones such as potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), pepper (Capsicum spp.), and eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). Thus, not only does var. carolinense need to be controlled in fields and pastures as a direct competitor, but also it needs to be managed in adjacent areas in order to limit its ability to serve as a host. Some of the important phytophagous insect pests that use it as a host include Colorado potato beetle [Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)], false Colorado potato beetle [Leptinotarsa juncta (Germar)], eggplant lacebug [Gargaphia solani (Heidemann)], potato stalk borer [Trichobaris trinotata (Say)], eggplant flea beetle [Epitrix fuscula (Crotch)], potato flea beetle [Epitrix cucumeris (Harris)], tobacco hornworm [Manduca sexta (Haworth)], pepper maggot [Zonosemata electa (Say)], yellowstriped armyworm [Spodoptera ornithogalli (Guenée)], eggplant leafminer [Tildenia inconspicuella (Murtfeldt)], potato tuberworm [Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)], pepper weevil [Anthonomus eugenii (Cano)], potato psyllid Paratrioza cacherelli (Sulc.)], and eggplant tortoise beetle [Gratiana pallidula (Boheman)] (Somes 1916; Anderson and Walker 1937; Foott 1968; Bassett and Munro 1986; Hare and Kennedy 1986; Wise and Sacchi 1996; Capinera 2001; Kariyat et al. 2013). The species also acts as a host reservoir to viral and fungal pathogens, including tobacco mosaic virus, tobacco vein mottling virus, tobacco etch virus, peach rosette mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus, tomato leafspot fungus (Septoria lycopersici Speg.), and early blight of tomato [Alternaria solani (Ell. & G. Martin) Sor.]; Pritchard and Porte 1921; Ellis 1971; Ramsdell and Myers 1978; Natsuaki et al. 1992; Blancard 2012; Goyal et al. 2012).

Solanum carolinense var. carolinense is a weakly andromonoecious species with a system of self-incompatibility, and several studies have investigated the ecology, evolution, and biochemistry of its reproductive biology. The developmentally terminal and indeterminate inflorescence develops acropetally and produces variable numbers of hermaphroditic flowers at the proximal end and staminate flowers at the distal end. Studies of andromonoecy in the species have shown that sex expression in the inflorescence (i.e., the ratio of hermaphroditic:staminate flowers) can be influenced by various environmental and ecological factors (Solomon 1985; Steven et al. 1999; Wise and Cummins 2006; Wise et al. 2008; Wise and Hébert 2010), whereas others have found evidence that sex expression is a heritable trait (Elle 1998, 1999; Elle and Meagher 2000). Other research has shown that the androecium of both hermaphroditic and staminate flowers is fully developed and produces fertile pollen (Solomon 1986) and that the production of pollen in staminate flowers functions as a reward to attract pollinators as well as a source of pollen for other flowers (Solomon 1986, 1987; Connolly and Anderson 2003; but see Vallejo-Marín and Rausher 2007).

While Solanum carolinense var. carolinense exhibits most traits of a weedy species, a notable exception is its system of self-incompatibility (SI), which contrasts with self-compatible breeding systems in most weedy species (Travers et al. 2004). As with other species in the Solanaceae, S. carolinense var. carolinense has been shown to have a gametophytic SI system under control of the single S-locus gene, which regulates stigma-pollen compatibility (e.g., Richman et al. 1995; Travers et al. 2004). Studies into the SI system of Solanum carolinense var. carolinense have shown that the diversity of S-alleles is lower than in other SI species (Richman et al. 1995), and the SI system is plastic because of variability in the strength of SI alleles (Mena-Ali and Stephenson 2007). Even though the SI system becomes less stringent as flowers age or when there is a lack of cross pollen (Travers et al. 2004), selfed progeny do not experience the deleterious effects of inbreeding depression, which may facilitate colonization and establishment of the species (Mena-Ali et al. 2008; Kariyat et al. 2011)."
wfo-0001026491,"Solanum basendopogon can be distinguished from the other members of series Caripensia and from the taxa in the closely allied series, Suaveolentia, by its compound inflorescence, large number of flowers, and adaxially pubescent corolla. In vegetative features, S. basendopogon is most similar to S. trachycarpum and to the S. caripense - S. heiseri complex. It can be distinguished from the former, which it resembles in habit, by the usually compound leaves with denser pubescence, and branched inflorescences bearing numerous flowers &hellip; . These features plus the habit &hellip; and leaf (or terminal leaflet) shape (more ovate) serve to distinguish S. basendopogon from the S. caripense - S. heiseri complex. (Anderson, 1977). The inflorescence of S. basendopogon is most similar to that of S. taeniotrichum; however, this latter species occurs in Costa Rica (vs. Peru), has a greater number of leaflets, has a climbing vine-like habit, and does not have the 2-celled bayonet hairs characteristic of S. basendopogon (Anderson, 1977; Seithe & Anderson, 1982)
Correll (1962) recognized two varieties. The type variety, known only from the type collection, has simple, lanceolate leaves with acuminate apices. Solanum basendopogon forma obtusum was defined as occasionally having 3-foliate leaves that are ovate-elliptic with broadly obtuse to rounded apices.
"
wfo-0001029709,"Solanum muricatum (pepino) is a domesticate of Andean origin vegetatively propagated by stem cuttings and esteemed for its edible fruit, a berry that is juicy, scented, mild and sweet, and that can be highly variable in shape and colour. When ripe the fruits have the flavour of musk-melon or canteloupe, and when unripe like cucumber (Prohens et al. 1996). It is known only from cultivation and is mentioned in the writings of the early Spanish explorers of the Andes (Anderson 1975; Prohens et al. 1996). The pepino has been grown for thousands of years in the Andean region, and it was an important crop during the times of the Inca Empire. However, until recently, concurrent with increasing interest in international markets, the pepino has been grown largely for local consumption (IPGRI 2004). It is often grown as an annual or pluriannual crop, and in the Andes is cultivated from sea level to above 3000 m elevation. In Europe it is being developed as a greenhouse crop (Prohens and Nuez 1999; Prohens et al. 2010). The pepino is well-represented in pre-Colombian pottery from the Paracas and Mochica cultures of coastal Peru (Prohens et al. 1996) and in offerings from the Cuzco area (Vargas 1962). Many fruit shapes were recorded by early chroniclers, and the crop's distribution at the time of the Spanish arrival was far beyond its origins in Peru and stretched as far north as Mexico (Prohens et al. 1996). It was distributed elsewhere in cultivation following on from the Ruiz and Pavon expedition to discover the plant riches of Spanish territories in the New World (Prohens et al. 1996), from where it was introduced into Europe in the late 17th century, then reintroduced more widely in the late 19th century, including into the United States. Prohens et al. (1996) suggest that among the reasons for neglect of the pepino as a fruit crop include its narrow temperature range for fruit set, its clonal nature leading to narrowly adapted genotypes in particular places, high sensitivity of fruit quality to environmental conditions during ripening, and the length of time needed for fruit ripening. This is being overcome, especially in Asia (pepino is very popular in China), but the pepino still lags far behind other solanaceous fruits in popularity, despite its nutritional and flavour qualities. The 3-celled antrorse simple trichomes on vegetative parts of S. muricatum have been termed bayonet hairs and are a common feature of the Basarthrum group (Seithe and Anderson 1982); they are transparent, stiff and the cells are long as compared to other simple trichomes in Solanum. Correll (1962) distinguished the pepino by its simple leaves, but ternate or pinnatifid juvenile leaves occur on some plants (these were distinguished at the varietal level by Correll). Although sometimes attaining a vining habit like other members of the Basarthrum group, most plants of S. muricatum are shrubby in cultivation. The relationships of the pepino in the Basathrum group are not clear; karotypically it is the most distinct and most variable of all species examined (Bernardello and Anderson 1990), and it has been suggested that it arose from one of several Andean taxa (e.g., S. basendopogon, S. caripense, S. tabanoense). In the analyses of Weese and Bohs (2007) it was sister to S. fraxinifolium, the only other member of the group included; Sarkinen et al. (2013) resolved S. muricatum as the first branch in the Basathrum group.

wfo-0001022561,"Lycianthes tysoniana, a Panamanian endemic, is closely related to Lycianthes acidochondra (Bitter) Bitter, another Panamanian endemic. Lycianthes tysoniana differs from L. acidochondra in having coriaceous leaves with prominent veins (as opposed to leaf blades that are thick chartaceous to subcoriaceous in texture without prominent veins); the two species also differ in the texture of their trichomes with L. tysoniana having very rigid stellate trichomes with rays that are not crisped and L. acidochondra having fine stellate trichomes with rays that are often crisped. The sclerotic granules at the tip of the mature fruit of both species can reach a length of 5 mm long and are dolobriform to cruciform in shape. Our treatment of L. tysoniana here includes material from Province Veraguas that differs from the originally described populations from Province Panama in having larger leaves and a flowering calyx that can have some purple color on the appendages."
wfo-1000023513,"Lycianthes coloradensis is most similar to L. purpusii (Brandegee) Bitter of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Both species are densely pubescent with yellow, orange or brown simple or long-stalked dendritic or multangulate-stellate trichomes, have relatively long pedicels, and entire corollas. Lycianthes coloradensis differs from L. purpusii in usually having the rays of the stellate trichome rebranched (versus rarely rebranched), having much shorter appendages to 5.5 mm in flower (vs. to 17 mm long in flower), and having subequal stamens (vs. unequal). This species is also similar to L. furcatistellata Bitter of Costa Rica and Panama but differs in having denser pubescence and only having dendritic or multangulate-stellate trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface (vs. mostly simple trichomes in L. furcatistellata). It is somewhat similar to the Colombian species L. dendriticothrix Bitter, only known to the authors from the type material; it differs from that species in having equal stamens (vs. unequal) and coarser trichomes (vs. fine trichomes) (Dean et al. 2020).
"
wfo-0001030281,"Solanum pedemontanum is a common species of the eastern Andean slopes and the adjacent Amazonian lowlands, however, like other members of the section, it is not found far into the Amazon Basin. The range of S. pedemontanum overlaps with that of S. leucopogon and the two are often found in close proximity at forest edges or gaps within the forest. Because they are sympatric and have similar morphologies, comparisons of S. pedemontanum and S. leucopogon are inevitable. Both are vining species of light gaps and disturbed areas of the eastern slope of the Andes with similar floral morphologies including creamy white corollas, approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, strongly connivent yellow stamens, and temporally andromonoecious breeding systems. The fruits of both species are also similar and are orange to red, leathery berries. The most notable difference between these species is the hair characteristics. The hairs of S. pedemontanum are generally white to tan and are stellate with 6-8 rays that are the same length as the midpoint. Solanum leucopogon is distinct with red hairs that have a greatly extended midpoint (1-5 (8) mm in length). The leaves of S. leucopogon are often lobed while those of S. pedemontanum are entire. Additionally, the calyx of S. leucopogon is much larger (5-10 mm in flower and 8-12 mm in fruit versus 2-4 in flower 4-6 in fruit mm in S. pedemontanum). Phylogenetic results place S. pedemontanum sister to a clade composed of S. volubile and S. aturense but with weak support. These latter two species are common throughout the Caribbean and reach into northern South America, however, they do not reach the range of S. pedemontanum. While the flowers of S. aturense are typically larger than those of S. pedemontanum, the flowers of S. volubile do overlap in size with S. pedemontanum. Perhaps the most obvious difference between these taxa lies in the cauline hairs, which are often long-stalked in S. aturense and S. volubile while they are nearly sessile to 0.5 mm in S. pedemontanum. Even in collections of S. volubile and S. aturense that have shorter-stalked hairs, the pale hairs of S. pedemontanum that often form a dense tomentum, especially on the abaxial leaf surface, are distinctive. The epithet for this species was chosen to describe the distribution of this species along the piedmont of the eastern Andes and adjacent Amazon (Nee et al. 2006).
"
wfo-0001031646,"Solanum taeniotrichum can be recognized by the combination of compound leaves, highly branched inflorescences, a shrubby scandent habit, abundant pubescence of simple multicellular hairs, and red fruits. In Panama it is only known from the Parque Internacional La Amistad (PILA) just near the Costa Rican border and has been collected only rarely."
wfo-0001027284,"Solanum crassinervium is one of the climbing species, and can be distinguished from the other species in the section by the somewhat fleshy texture of the stems, leaves, and flowers, its ovate to elliptical leaves with conspicuous secondary veins that are visible in fresh and dried material, and its occasionally branched inflorescences. This is the most robust species of sect. Herpystichum. Solanum crassinervium is most similar to S. evolvulifolium and S. loxophyllum, but differs from both species in its robust habit, broadly ovate leaves (vs. mostly oblong), fleshy calyx and corolla, and inflorescences that may be simple and branched on the same individual. It can be easily differentiated from S. evolvulifolium by its much larger leaves, petioles, and internodes. The leaves of both S. crassinervium and S. loxophyllum are somewhat fleshy, and both species tend to dry very dark to nearly black; however, S. crassinervium has more secondary veins (5-7 vs. 3-4 pairs) and these are prominent abaxially, whereas those of S. loxophyllum are often obscure within the fleshy leaf blade (translucent in living material and flush with the leaf surface in dried material). The often stout and branched inflorescences of S. crassinervium differ from those of S. loxophyllum, which are apparently always simple, and are very slender and delicate. Furthermore, inflorescences of S. crassinervium are typically produced in the leafy part of the stem, as compared to those of S. loxophyllum, which are typically borne on older, leafless parts of the stem.
"
wfo-0001030949,"Solanum runsoriense is a montane forest edge species with large, openly branching inflorescences of purple (blue) flowers. It is not likely to be confused with any other species on the African continent; it the only species of the ANS clade with short-styled and long-styled flowers (see below, Fig. 21). Solanum runsoriense is partly sympatric with S. terminale but occurs at higher elevations and apparently in wetter forests. Solanum terminale has more deeply stellate corollas, flowers tightly clustered in groups rather than evenly and widely spaced on the inflorescence branches, and bright red rather than blackish purple berries. Pubescence is extremely variable in S. runsoriense; populations from Ethiopia (described as S. benderianum) are almost completely glabrous on stems and leaves, while populations from the Ruwenzoris in Democratic Republic of the Congo and from the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya are densely pubescent with golden dendritic trichomes. Individual populations are isolated in what has been recognised as the Afromontane (Wright 1978, 1981) or Tropic-montane Flora (Linder 2014) and limited gene exchange may allow these variants to become fixed. Flower, fruit and seed morphology are constant throughout the species range. Solanum runsoriense is morphologically closely related with S. macrothyrsum. The two species share openly branched inflorescences and S. macrothyrsum is superfically similar vegetatively to more glabrous forms of S. runsoriense, but S. macrothyrsum has deeply stellate corollas and anthers that open with two terminal pores that never extend to slits as the flower ages, while S. runsoriense has shallowly stellate corollas and anther pores that extend to longitudinal slits with age. Solanum runsoriense has the only member of the ANS clade that is heterostylous; in all but one of the specimens we have examined flowers on a given stem are either short-styled or long-styled. The Ethiopian collection Gilbert 138 (K000788688) is the only one we have seen with fruit and short-styled flowers on same plant. No other inflorescences with short-styled flowers had fruits, and when specimens were fruiting, all flowers in the inflorescence had set fruit. Collections are often of some sheets with flowers (short-styled) and duplicates with fruit (e.g., Schimper 1227); it is not clear if these represent branches from a single plant or different individuals. Solanum runsoriense could be either monoecious or dioecious, but most monoecious solanums have a mixture of short- and long-styled flowers in the same inflorescence (Diggle and Miller 2004; Miller and Diggle 2003; Whalen and Costich 1986) so we suspect S. runsoriense is another instance of dioecy in the genus (see Symon 1970; Symon 1979; Anderson and Symon 1989; Knapp et al. 1998; Martine et al. 2009). Field observations on the breeding system of S. runsoriense are a priority, and microscopic examination of pollen morphology to see if long-styled flowers have inaperurate pollen like other dioecious solanums (e.g., Knapp et al. 1998) might help to determine the breeding system of this species."
wfo-1000033128,"Lycianthes breedlovii is a shrub to vine with zigzag branching due to widely divaricate branching angles, yellow to orange stalked, multangulate-stellate trichomes, white flowers with violet markings, and unequal stamens. It is closely related to L. hortulana Standl. & L.O.Williams, described from Honduras. The two species are geographically isolated from one another, with no populations of either species known to occur in Guatemala. They have diverged from one another in pedicel length (L. hortulana flowers have pedicels 3-9 mm long vs 9-16 mm long), flower size (L. hortulana has corollas that are 0.6-1 cm long vs 0.9-1.5 cm), corolla pubescence (L. hortulana has very sparse pubescence on the abaxial side of the corolla lobes vs dense), and stamen length (L. hortulana has equal stamens vs unequal) (Dean et al. 2019).
"
wfo-0001026539,"Solanum bicorne is easily differentiated from others in the group by the presence of clustered leaves on short shoots. Dunal, in naming Solanum bicorne, mistook the clustered stem leaves as being the rosette of a possibly acaulescent herb when in fact the plant is a high climbing, robust, woody vine. This species is similar to S. glaucescens, especially with respect to the white, heterandrous, stellate flowers, but differs by its leaves narrowed to the base with definite wings on the petiole and leafy short shoots that have densely crowded leaves. A pair of prickles at the base of the petiole is present in S. glaucescens but absent in S. bicorne. There has been confusion over the correct name for this species, and many specimens are annotated S. refractum in herbaria. Solanum refractum is a distinct species with pinnate leaves, but also occurs in the dry forests of southern Mexico (specimens of S. refractum were often annotated S. aculeolatum)."
wfo-0001028934,"The concept of S. lanceifolium presented above is a broad definition and encompasses much morphological variability. If one were to look at two specimens of S. lanceifolium there is a great likelihood that they would question whether they belong to the same species due to the great range of phenotypes in the species. However, drawing boundaries between phenotypes is nearly impossible due to the continuous variability of characters. Some of the most obvious differences in many collections are leaf size and pubescence. Leaves of many of the Mexico and Central America specimens are small with abaxial surfaces that are so densely pubescent that the mesophyll is not visible. Specimens from the Caribbean islands often have much larger leaves that are very sparsely pubescent which likely led to these being named as S. lanceifolium var. litorale. Because these phenotypic differences are continuous, it is not possible to draw boundaries and differentiate these as distinct species. One example of local variation includes collections from Dominica, such as Whitefoord 7021 (BM) and Nicolson 2163 (MO), that have large leaves (to 15 x 5 cm) that are thinner and less pubescent than normal. However, other specimens from the Caribbean have large, densely pubescent leaves and some Central American specimens (notably some of the higher elevation collections from Nicaragua) have very large, sparsely pubescent leaves. The presence of these intermediates on the spectrum makes it necessary for me to lump these seemingly disparate phenotypes under a broad species concept. The best characters to define S. lanceifolium are the presence of many small (1-2 mm long), broad-based, recurved prickles on the stem, the filiform pedicels that expand distally, especially in fruit, the small flowers with corollas 1-2 cm in diameter, and the generally small (3-7 x 1-3 cm), unlobed, membranaceous leaves that are moderately to densely pubescent below."
wfo-0001027880,"Solanum evolvulifolium, a climbing species, is recognizable by its characteristic distichous leaf arrangement and branching pattern. The main stem of this species is most often encountered climbing on tree trunks, attached with adventitious roots at the nodes; secondary branches extend away from the main stem. Higher order branches are typically distichous and arise at ca. 45 degree angles, often giving the plant a characteristic, flattened appearance. The leaves often diminish in size along a branch, occasionally to a branching point or inflorescence, and then increase in size again. The pedicels, calyx and corolla are frequently pinkish-white to greenish-pink. This species can be distinguished from other simple leaved, viny members of sect. Herpystichum by the uniformly short internodes, somewhat coriaceous leaves (instead of chartaceous or somewhat fleshy), and the flattened aspect of the branches that results from the distichous leaves. South American collections are more variable than those from Central America in leaf shape and, especially, the degree of pubescence. The calyx lobes of Central American collections are broadly ovate and rounded apically, whereas the lobes of most South American collections are deltoid in shape and acute apically. These calyx characters, however, are not sufficiently uniform, nor are they correlated with other characters that might justify segregation of S. evolvulifolium into one or more additional species. Several extreme forms from South America are included here, and these include especially robust forms from Colombia and Ecuador and an especially pubescent form from Ecuador. It is possible that the differences merit specific status, but both forms are represented by only a few collections and are thus included within a broadly defined and variable, yet easily identifiable S. evolvulifolium. Furthermore, the three sequenced accessions of S. evolvulifolium, including one accession of the robust form and two of the standard form, form a monophyletic group together with S. crassinervium and S. loxophyllum (Fig. 4). The robust form of S. evolvulifolium is strongly supported as sister to Central American accessions of S. evolvulifolium lending support for its inclusion in a morphologically variable, yet easily recognizeable S. evolvulifolium. 
"
wfo-0001032507,"Morphological characters such as elongated anthers and paniculate inflorescences suggest this species is closely related to S. bicorne and S. refractum. It is strongly supported as sister to S. bicorne (as S. refractum) in molecular phylogenetic analyses of Levin et al. (2006). It can be distinguished from both those species by its non-prickly inflorescence rhachis and pentagonal, purple flowers. Solanum wendlandii is quite variable in appearance. Most herbarium specimens, collected from flowering twigs, have only simple, entire leaves while much of the rest of the vine carries pinnatifid to pinnate leaves. Simple-leaved collections of Solanum wendlandii can be confused with S. cobanense, but the leaves of the latter are more coriaceous and the flowers are stellate and very fleshy rather than pentagonal in outline with thin petal tissue like those of S. wendlandii. Non-flowering pinnately-leaved specimens of S. wendlandii can be very similar to S. refractum, but lack the densely prickly inflorescence of that species. Flower size in S. wendlandii is, on the face of it, extremely variable, but this is in part due to flower growth throughout anthesis. Flowers of this species last approximately 3 days (Shelly et al., 2000), and on the first day they are both darker purple and smaller than on subsequent flowering days. Plants with small-flowered inflorescences (young ones with flowers only one day old) can be confused with S. triunfense and S. bicorne, but both of these species have stamens of equal size. The breeding system of this species has not been closely investigated. Nearly, if not all, cultivated material seems to bear only male flowers with vestigial styles and fruit from cultivated collections is almost never seen (although immature fruits are described in the protologue; Hooker, 1887). Fruiting material is seldom collected from the wild, perhaps because the plants only produce fruit upon reaching the canopy. The species is possibly dioecious, accounting for the paucity of fruiting collections. Solanum wendlandii is apparently native from southern Mexico to western Panama in wet forests of the Gulf Coast, but the exact range is difficult to discern since it is seldom collected in the wild, is widely planted for the showy panicles of large flowers, and label data usually do not specify whether the plants were cultivated or truly wild. It is definitely native from central Veracruz south through Central America to Panama, but all other collections outside this range seem to be either escapes from cultivation or merely cultivated plants, although not always so stated on herbarium labels. We have not cited these many collections here, but full details can be found on Solanaceae Source. We have seen cultivated or perhaps naturalized material from the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, United Kingdom, United States of America, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. In Veracruz, Mexico, where the plants seem to be native, the green fruits were pecked open by birds, which remove the seeds and green pulp, leaving only an empty shell (Nee & Taylor 29770)."
wfo-0001030155,"Solanum pachyandrum differs from all other species in section Aculeigerum by the presence of stout armed prickles on its pedicels and non-tapering (oblong) anthers. Additionally, S. pachyandrum is restricted to the western lowlands of Ecuador and northwestern Peru. This species is geographically isolated from all other members of the section. The large fruits are eaten by local people and are considered a great treat by children (J. Campos, pers. comm.).
"
wfo-0001027125,"Solanum cobanense differs from all species of section Aculeigerum except S. truinfense by its woody canopy liana habit, coriaceous leaves, and large, fleshy flowers (4-6 cm in diameter) that are not heterandrous. Some specimens of S. wendlandii have simple leaves and might be confused with S. cobanense, but the rotate flowers of S. wendlandii with unequal anthers are distinctive. Solanum cobanense differs from S. triunfense, with which it is nearly sympatric, in its regular calyx lobes that do not completely enclose the bud at late stages, the completely glabrous stems and new growth, and the acute, rather than attenuate, leaf bases. The flowers of S. cobanense are more deeply stellate than those of S. triunfense, but this character can be difficult to assess in herbarium sheets where flowers are collected at different stages of development.
"
wfo-0001028147,"Solanum glaucescensdiffers from other members of section Aculeigerum by the presence of paired recurved prickles flanking the petioles (Figure 4). These appear stipular, but stipules are absent in the Solanaceae, and these are prickles like those found on the rest of the plant. The similar situation occurs in the unrelated S. microphyllum (Lam.) Dunal of the West Indies (Knapp, 2009). Solanum glaucescens differs from S. bicorne with which it is partly sympatric in its widely spaced leaves (not clustered as in S. bicorne), smaller yellowish green rather than white flowers and in its glabrous leaf undersides. Solanum glaucescens is usually a more delicate plant than S. bicorne. Trichomes, if present, on all parts of S. glaucescens are small and unicellular, not the uniseriate trichomes with elongate basal cells of S. bicorne.
"
wfo-0001030803,"Solanum refractum is similar to S. alternatopinnatum of southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, and northern Argentina but the terminal leaflets in that species are usually petiolulate and not broadly confluent with the uppermost pair of lateral leaflets. The leaflets of S. refractum are occasionally puberulent with unbranched papillae on both surfaces in contrast to the consistently glabrous leaflets in S. alternatopinnatum. The inflorescence structure, flowers and fruits are very similar in S. alternatopinnatum and S. refractum. Solanum pachyandrum of Ecuador and Peru shares pinnately consistently pinnately compound leaves with S. refractum, but differs from it in its white flowers with ellipsoid anthers; the yellow-green flowers of S. refractum are more delicate than those of S. pachyandrum and have strongly tapered anthers. Solanum refractum, S. pachyandrum and S. alternatopinnatum all share a prickly inflorescence rhachis, a character that can be used to differentiate these species from cultivated S. wendlandii with pinnately compound leaves. Confusion over the application of the names S. refractum and S. bicorne has resulted in many specimens of S. bicorne being annotated in herbaria as S. refractum (in these cases the name S. aculeolatum was used for the plants here recognized as S. refractum). Considerable care must be exercised in using pre-2005 annotations on specimens not re-annotated for this treatment."
wfo-0001026490,"Solanum baretiae is a striking species with its relatively large, pentagonal corollas in shades of violet, yellow, or white (Fig. 2B in Tepe et al. 2012), and its soft-pubescent leaves that range from simple to 7-foliolate. Specimens of Solanum baretiae have been previously identified as the Ecuadorian Solanum chimborazense Bitter, from which it differs by its larger corollas (0.8-1.5 cm in Solanum baretiae vs. <1 cm in diameter in Solanum chimborazense), styles that are papillose or only sparsely pubescent (vs. densely pubescent with long trichomes in Solanum chimborazense), more flowers per inflorescence (1-8 in Solanum baretiae vs. mostly 1, but up to 3 in Solanum chimborazense), and filaments that are pubescent adaxially, but glabrous abaxially (vs. evenly pubescent on all surfaces in Solanum chimborazense). Solanum baretiae is sympatric with the exceedingly rare Solanum chachapoyasense Bitter but the latter species has stellate corollas (vs. pentagonal in Solanum baretiae), long filaments (3-3.5 mm in Solanum chachapoyasense vs. 0.5-1.5 mm in Solanum baretiae), and strictly simple leaves (vs. simple to 7-foliolate in Solanum baretiae). Solanum baretiae is also sympatric with several species of Solanum section Basarthrum (Bitter) Bitter, which can be scandent shrubs with compound leaves and somewhat similar flowers. These species, however, can easily be differentiated by the distinctive two-celled bayonet trichomes that characterize Solanum section Basarthrum (Seithe and Anderson 1982). The Andean species of Solanum sect. Anarrhichomenum are typically found in mid- to high-elevation cloud forest habitats that are moist throughout the year. Solanum baretiae appears to be an exception to this rule, however, as it occurs in forests and disturbed areas on the western slopes of the Andes which, in the latitudes of the Huancabamba-Amotape zone, experience a marked dry season. The number of leaflets in this species is highly variable, with the leaves ranging from simple to compound with seven leaflets. Seedlings and young vegetative shoots typically have compound leaves with five leaflets, whereas the number of leaflets on fertile shoots is much more variable. In general, the number of leaflets, along with the size of the lateral leaflets, decreases along the length of fertile shoots, and the leaves in the proximity of the flowers and fruits are, in many cases, simple or have only one or two tiny lateral leaflets. The number of leaflets is variable in many species of Solanum sect. Anarrhichomenum, but the range of variability seen in Solanum baretiae is shared only with that of Solanum sodiroi Bitter (Anderson et al. 1999). This species in named in honor of Jeanne Baret (1740-1807), an unwitting explorer who risked life and limb for love of botany and, in doing so, became the first woman to circumnavigate the world (Ridley 2010).


"
wfo-0001029150,"Solanum loxophyllum is a climbing species closely allied to S. evolvulifolium, with which it has frequently been synonymized. It differs from S. evolvulifolium in its thin, but distinctly fleshy, larger leaves, less regular branching, sinuous rather than more or less straight branches, older stems that are 8-shaped in cross section, a tendency toward cauliflory, its high-climbing habit - individuals have been seen to climb to 12 m or more (E.J. Tepe, pers. obs) - and distribution under 850 m (S. evolvulifolium has occasionally been collected as low as 250 m, but is most frequently encountered above 1,000 m). Solanum loxophyllum can be distinguished from other species of sect. Herpystichum by its fleshy leaves with inconspicuous veins (translucent in fresh material), cauliflorous inflorescences, and the distinctive older stems that are 8-shaped in cross section. The slender, delicate inflorescences emerge from the cleft between the two halves of the 8-shaped stems. Several collections from the area around Zapallo Grande and the Colorado community, Congoma Grande, are more robust and are more densely pubescent than collections from other areas. Herbarium specimens of S. loxophyllum typically dry very dark to nearly black, a character shared with S. crassinervium. Based on recent fieldwork, it appears that S. loxophyllum is widespread and quite common in the Pacific lowlands of Ecuador. It seems to be tolerant of intermediate levels of disturbance, and is abundant along trails and in secondary, but shady habitats. Flowering is apparently rather rare, and the flowers are inconspicuous and few in number. Consequently, S. loxophyllum is underrepresented in herbarium collections.
"
wfo-0001025856,"Solanum alternatopinnatum differs from other species of the S. wendlandii group by having compound leaves with clearly petiolulate leaflets, heterandrous flowers, and nearly herbaceous stems. Solanum alternatopinnatum, S. pachandrum and S. refractum also have pinnatifid compound leaves but do not have clearly petiolate leaflets and S. refractum occasionally has leaves that are only very shallowly lobed. A single specimen of S. alternatopinnatum (Glaziou 16294, K) has been seen with simple leaves. The stems of S. alternatopinnatum are herbaceous or rarely subwoody in contrast to the subwoody stems of S. refractum. These species are also completely allopatric, with S. refractum restricted to southern Mexico, S. pachyandrum found in the Huancabamba depression of northern Peru and southern Ecuador and S. alternatopinnatum ranging from Brazil and Paraguay to northern Argentina. 
"
wfo-0001031729,"Solanum thelopodium tends to grow in flooded forests, rather than on terra firme, where its close relative, S. monarchostemon, occurs. Its distribution is more easterly in the Amazon basin than that of S. monarchostemon. Flower colour in S. thelopodium is usually pinkish, while flowers of S. monarchostemon are usually greenish or greenish white. Label data do indicate, however, that some plants of S. thelopodium have greenish or white flowers. Colour polymorphism for pink (or purple) and white flowers is common in the spiny solanums, but less so in the non-spiny members of the genus, but exceptions do occur. Solanum thelopodium possesses a thick woody taproot that is only occasionally collected (see Fig. 2 in Knapp, 2000). This feature may be related to its flooded forest habitat. Plants submerged during the wet season probably die back, re-sprouting as the water recedes during the dry season and flowering a fruiting in a short space of time."
wfo-0001429595,"Solanum marmoratum had long confused botanists working with Argentinian solanums. The flowers of S. marmoratum are among the tiniest in the morelloid solanums rivalled only by the globally distributed S. americanum and S. nitidibaccatum and the North American S. emulans Raf.. Solanum nitidibaccatum also has somewhat marbled berries but is always extremely sticky and covered with glandular trichomes, in contrast to the eglandular pubescence of S. marmoratum. Solanum americanum and S. emulans both have eglandular pubescence but have purplish black rather than green marbled berries. The fleshy spreading calyx lobes of S. marmoratum are distinct from those of all of these species with tiny flowers."
wfo-0001027539,"Solanum dianthum as circumscribed here is quite variable in pubescence, with some populations (notably those from around Unduavi, Bolivia) having loose spreading pubescence and somewhat more ovate leaves. Both this morphological variant and plants with appressed and somewhat strigose pubescence and more elliptic leaves are present on one of the sheets of the type collection (Bang 2492, NY, barcode 00139130). On an annotation slip on that sheet, C.V. Morton suggested that the small branch with looser pubescence in the centre of the sheet represented a different taxon. Examination of a range of specimens however suggest that this pubescence type grades into the more common appressed pubescence of the other sheets of Bang 2492, and that these collections, while on the face of it quite different in pubescence, are conspecific. Solanum dianthum is somewhat similar morphologically to S. leptocaulon, but differs in its non-prostrate habit, stellate (versus campanulate) corollas and much larger anthers (3.5–5 mm long versus 2.5–3 mm long)."
wfo-0001027189,"Solanum concarense is an exceptionally rare species; it is known from a single population along the old dirt track from Concarán to Santa Rosa, in an area that is highly anthropogenically altered for agriculture and ranching. The population is found along the road bank in deep, sandy soil at the foot of Prosopis trees. Various groups of collectors have searched for additional populations, but to no effect. Plants grown in cultivation (from rhizomes) have set no fruit (G.E. Barboza, pers. comm.), so the species is quite possibly self-incompatible. This may indicate that the known population is composed of several individuals or that there are additional populations not yet encountered. Morphologically S. concarense is very similar to S. triflorum of the Morelloid clade, with fleshy, deeply pinnatifid leaves, but differs in its larger flowers with creamy yellow, ellipsoid anthers and berries with eight large stone cells versus flowers with bright yellow narrowly ellipsoid anthers and berries with many small stone cells. Solanum triflorum is an annual herb, while S. concarense is clearly a rhizomatous perennial. Barboza et al. (2013) treated this species as a member of the Morelloid clade in Flora Argentina, but more recent molecular work has shown it to be deeply nested in the Dulcamaroid clade. Solanum concarense shares the morphological synapomorphy of the Dulcamaroid calde (Knapp 2013) of the deep pedicel sleeve; a cup-shaped structure in which the base of the pedicel is inserted.
"
wfo-0001022464,"Lycianthes oliveriana is a distinctive species with many-flowered axillary inflorescences, relatively small (ca. 1 cm in diameter) flowers with valvate aestivation and thick fleshy corollas, plump, ellipsoid to slight obellipsoid anthers and somewhat warty calyces with no appendages. The berries appear to have a slightly woody pericarp; this woodiness coupled with the somewhat accrescent calyx tube gives the fruits of L. oliveriana the look of tiny acorns. Lycianthes oliveriana appears to be dioecious, with long- and short-styled flowers on different plants. This needs confirmation in the field, and L. oliveriana would be an ideal subject for a reproductive biology study since it is relatively common and widely distributed. Lycianthes oliveriana could potentially be confused with L. parasitica, a species with a wider distribution in tropical Asia outside of New Guinea. Berries of L. oliveriana are somewhat woody on dry specimens and have many seeds, while those of L. parasitica are juicy with a translucent pericarp and only have two (to very occasionally four) seeds. Flowers of L. parasitica are cosexual while those of L. oliveriana are either long- or short-styled. On New Guinea L. oliveriana has a wide variety of leaf shapes. The Malaku specimens are of plants with broadly elliptic leaves."
wfo-0001029599,"In describing S. miyakojimense Yamazaki and Takushi (1991) suggested it was endemic to the Ryuku Islands; we have since found it to be more widely distributed, but still only along the island arc that runs south from Miyakojima Island to the Batanes Islands in the Philippines. Solanum miyakojimense is superficially similar to both S. procumbens and S. violaceum. It differs from S. procumbens, which occurs from China east to Thailand and the islands of Timor and Flores (Indonesia), in its seaside habitat; it can also be distinguished in its straight or only slightly curved stem prickles (versus strongly hooked), tiny inflorescences with only a few flowers with no or a very tiny peduncle (versus a longer thin peduncle), smaller flowers with broadly triangular corolla lobes (versus flowers with long-triangular corolla lobes), shorter pedicels in fruit and seeds with sinuate (versus pentagonal) cell walls. Berries of S. procumbens are bright red and globose at maturity, while those of S. miyakojimense are orange or orange-red and usually somewhat ellipsoid (Hsu et al. 2007)."
wfo-0001028138,"Solanum glandulosipilosum is morphologically most similar to S. aloysiifolium, sharing with that species narrowly ellipsoid buds and small green or purple berries. It differs from S. aloysiifolium in its copious glandular pubescence and fewer (6 versus 10) stone cells per berry. The two species are sympatric, growing in similar disturbed and moist forest habitats, but are easily distinguishable vegetatively. DNA data does not show the two species as sister; S. glandulosipilosum resolved as a member of a group with S. americanum, S. nigrescens and other North American taxa together with a large number of polyploid taxa with no obvious morphological affinity, while S. aloysiifolium was sister to somewhat similar and geographically close S. chenopodioides and S. enantiophyllanthum."
wfo-0001028674,"Solanum insidiosum, as delimited here, is a species of great morphological plasticity, principally in leaf shape, pubescence density and presence or absence of prickles. Leaf shape varies from ovate, ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate and decurrent on the petiole, margins vary from entire to lobed or angulate, and pubescence density is also quite variable, especially between juvenile and adult plants. Lobed-angulate leaf margins are found in some collections, while other specimens have lanceolate, entire leaves with very sparse pubescence."
wfo-0001027432,"Solanum decompositiflorum can be easily recognised by its oblong-elliptic to long-oval-elliptic leaves with entire or lobed (angulate) margins, attenuate leaf bases, 2-3-branched inflorescences and the subtruncate to cuspidate calyx lobes. The indument is highly variable and polymorphic in this species, varying from scabrous with sparse porrect stellate trichomes to velutinous-tomentose. Those plants that are scabrous come from more humid localities in the states of Minas Gerais, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro. These trichomes are sessile, with a long midpoint and reduced lateral rays about ¼ the size of the midpoint. Specimens collected in the cerrado, in campos rupestres and in open areas, also have variable pubescence, from tomentose-velutinous to velutinous to glabrescent, the trichomes are either persistent or deciduous. In tomntose-veltinous plants, the trichomes are very dense and the lateral rays overlap to completely cover the leaf surface. Other plants have a looser, more open sparse indument, in which the lateral rays do not overlap. The holotype of Solanum decompositiflorum, from Rio de Janeiro, is a juvenile plant, with repand, prickly leaves, sub-scabrous indument, sessile porrect stellate trichomes with a multicellular midpoint, dichotomous inflorescences with a few young flowers and buds. This character combination is often found in juvenile plants from humid areas, principally Rio de Janeiro and near Viçosa in Minas Gerais. This juvenile type and the fact that much material collected since has been from adult plants, has meant that much material of S. decompositiflorum was encountered undetermined in herbaria. Specimens collected in some areas of Minas Gerais (e.g. Mello Barreto 7848, Widgren s.n., Mósen 977), Distrito Federal (Irwin et al. 8346) and Bahia (Harley et al. 27258) have velutinous pubescence, with stipitate porrect stellate trichomes. Material from Goias (Irwin et al. 34340) has lax and deciduous pubescence, intermediate between that of the type specimen (Martius s.n.) and specimens collected in Lagoa Santa. Solanum decompositiflorum can be confused with S. pycnanthemum which also occurs in SE Brazil, but can be distinguished from it by its larger leaves, smaller flowers (2-2.5 cm in diameter), smaller calyx with minute subtruncate or cuspidate lobes and its smaller anthers and shorter style. Solanum decompositiflorum is a species of wide distribution, and is encountered in the Northeast, Central-East and Southeast regions of Brazil, while S. pycnanthemum is restricted to the Southeast, in more mesic environments."
wfo-0001030810,"Solanum remyanum is restricted to Chile, and is distinguished by the pinnate, or more usually bipinnate leaves. The pinnae of S. remyanum are broader than those of S. brachyantherum, the other Chilean species with pinnate leaves. Additionally, the flowers are larger than those of S. brachyantherum, in S. remyanum the anthers are ca. 3 mm long compared with ca. 1 mm long in S. brachyantherum. Solanum multifidum from Peru has a similar leaf morphology, but the leaves of S. multifidum are glabrous and the petiole and internodes more prominantly winged; the leaves of S. remyanum are always pubescent and the petioles are usually distinct or with only a narrow wing (up to 1 mm wide)."
wfo-0001029524,"Solanum mesopliarthrum as delimited here can be recognised by its shrubby habit with flexuose and decumbent branches. The entire plant is lanate, but occasionally scabrous individuals have been collected (e.g., Gentry et al. 14384, Phillippe et al. 2132); the trichomes are grey to rusty, stellate or multangulate with a filamentous midpoint of 4-8 cells that can be up to 1 mm long and is generally cured or coiled at the apex. The leaves are strongly discolorous, with the adaxial surfaces dark green to yellowish rusty and the epidermis clearly visible, and the lower surface yellow to grey and densely pubescent. In adult plants the leaf margins are entire, while on young plants they are angulate or somewhat lobed (Vogl 816). This species can be distinguished easily from Solanum accrescens, with which it shares a white corolla, by its 2-3 branched inflorescences with many flowers, smaller corolla ca. 2.5 cm in diameter, hirsute ovary with stellate trichomes with long midpoints on mature fruits and short calyx lobes. Specimens of S. mesopliarthrum have also been misidentified as S. subserratum (a species of uncertain affinities from the same region), S. erythrotrichum and S. velutinum. Solanum subserratum has an indument of long-stalked, glandular stellate trichomes with a glandular midpoint and larger inflorescences with up to 30 purple flowers. Solanum erythrotrichum and S. velutinum have few-flowered simple inflorescences with larger (to 3 cm in diameter) purple or blue flowers and a scabrous or velutinous, rather than lanate, indument. Specimens cited as Solanum accrescens from Venezuela by Benítez de Rojas & Medina (2001) are most likely to be specimens of S. mesopliarthrum, superficially similar to and often confused with S. accrescens. Solanum mesopliarthrum is very common in the regions cited in Benitez de Rojas & Medina (2001)."
wfo-0001032299,"Solanum velleum is a shrub or treelet, and can be recognised by the dense hirsute reddish-brown to rusty indument on the entire plant. Leaf shape and pubescence are very variable in S. velleum, especially between juvenile and adult plants. Juvenile plants have heavily armed stems, and repand, ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaves with a hirsute, reddish brown indument of porrect stellate trichomes that are glandular, sessile to long-stalked to 4 mm, with a multicellular midpoint. Stems of adult plants are generally without prickles, and leaves are generally elliptic, velutinous rather than hirsute and smaller than leaves from juvenile plants. The morphological extremes in S. velleum are so distinct that they have been described as distinct taxa. A series of field observations and collections (Agra & Stehmann 5344, 5345) clearly show this variation to be gradual and with intermediates in the key characters, evidence for this being infraspecific variation. Many specimens of Solanum leptostachys, a mid-sized tree with long simple inflorescences of small violet flowers have been misidentified as S. velleum. "
wfo-0001429757,"Trompettia cardenasiana is similar to Brugmansia species in having both pendant flowers and fleshy fruits. It is, however, readily distinguishable by its much smaller flowers, small, narrowly elliptic leaves, small, round fruits, and tetrahedral seeds."
wfo-0001026397,"Solanum aturense has one of the most extensive ranges of the section and has a correspondingly large variation in phenotypes. Perhaps most conspicuous is the variability in pubescence. Species range from nearly glabrous to densely pubescent with long bristle-like hairs that may reach 5 mm in length. This variability is almost certainly due to environmental conditions and the age of the stem when collected; however, it has caused much confusion and is likely the cause for description of new species (such as the densely pubescent S. mirabile) that are at the extremes of the range of variability. The characteristics that define S. aturense are the subcoriaceous leaves that are never lobed and often have a revolute margin. Additionally, the fruits and seeds are the largest in the section and are excellent diagnostic characteristics. The geographical distribution of S. aturense is similar to that of S. volubile and these species share many morphological similarities. The former species typically has more robust flowers and fruits than S. volubile. Solanum volubile also has stellate pubescence on the ovary and base of the style that is absent in S. aturense. When flowers and fruits are absent the best character to differentiate these species are the leaves, which are more coriaceous in S. aturense and never lobed, whereas those of S. volubile are often deeply lobed. The etymology of the S. aturense has been difficult to assess. The most obvious implication would be a reference to Atures, Venezuela, especially since the label also indicates the Orinoco River; however, the species is not known from this area. Another possibility is that Pasto in Dept. Nariño, Colombia, was previously referred to as Atures. (M. Nee pers. comm.). Although Nariño is at the southern edge of the species range, this is a more plausible explanation from a biogeographical standpoint.
"
wfo-0001025850,"Solanum alphonsei is one of two species of the Dulcamaroid group found in the Nothofagus forests of southern Chile and adjacent Argentina; the other is S. valdiviense. Solanum alphonsei differs from S. valdiviense in being a vine with non-angled stems and twining petioles, in having open and divaricately branched inflorescences and in its leaves that are rhombic or deltate in outline. The corollas of S. alphonsei are in general smaller than those of S. valdiviense, and are less deeply lobed. Solanum alphonsei is much less commonly collected than is S. valdiviense. An extreme form with tiny leaves was given the herbarium name of “myrtilloides” by Witasek on a specimen in Vienna."
wfo-0001025783,"Solanum agnoston is known from only two localities, both along the main highway from Loja to Cuenca in southern Ecuador. It superficially resembles S. laxum, a species of southern Brazil that is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical environments, but differs from it in the dendritic trichomes of the lower leaf surfaces and the elliptic, pubescent buds. The leaves of the paratype specimen (Holm-Nielson et al. 5115) are thick and very shiny above, such that the venation of the upper surface is not visible; the leaves of Jaramillo et al. 8832 are not as shiny, but match in all other aspects. Label data on both specimens indicate the flowers are violet, but both duplicates of Jaramillo et al. 8832 I have been able to find are in fruit.
"
wfo-0001031007,"Solanum sanchez-vegae is a striking species, with large purple flowers and shiny rubbery leaves. It has long been subsumed in the more common and widely distributed S. aureum, with which it is very similar. Solanum aureum differs from S. sanchez-vegae in its smaller flowers, generally denser more congested pubescence of dendritic trichomes with many small, short branches (as opposed to loose dendritic trichomes with larger branches) and more northerly distribution. The ranges of S. aureum and S. sanchez-vegae slightly overlap in northern Peru, but in general S. aureum is an Ecuadorian species. I have previously identified specimens of S. sanchez-vegae as S. aligerum, a shrubby member of the clade with similar large, open inflorescences, but S. aligerum has white flowers and tufts of dendritic trichomes in the vein axils, rather than purple flowers and dendritic trichomes along the veins. Solanum sanchez-vegae also resembles the Venezuelan species S. dichroandrum Dunal, with which it shares loose pubescence and relatively large flowers; it differs from S. dichroandrum in its much larger (to 3 cm rather than to 2.5 cm) purple flowers, glabrous style and few-seeded berries.
"
wfo-0001031185,"Solanum septemlobum usually has seven-parted leaves (as the name implies), but as is common in this clade, leaf division varies from simple to seven-parted. It is not clear from herbarium specimens if these differences in leaf division have an environmental basis, but from field observations on the related S. dulcamara, their regulation is likely to be complex. Solanum septemlobum can be difficult to distinguish from its sympatric close relatives, S. pittosporifolium and S. lyratum, but the flowers are in general larger, and pubescence of stems and leaves is of stiff, curving white trichomes, not long glandular trichomes like those of S. lyratum. Solanum pittosporifolium occasionally has a few white trichomes on new stems and leaves, but they are usually very sparse and not as stiff, long or curved as those of S. septemlobum. Solanum septemlobum is a more northerly species than either S. lyratum or S. pittosporifolium, and almost abuts the range of S. dulcamara in Mongolia and northern Russia."
wfo-0001031885,"Solanum triunfense is very similar to S. cobanense, and has also been identified in herbaria as S. wendlandii. It differs from S. cobanense in its buds that are completely enclosed in the calyx until just before anthesis, the pubescence of simple uniseriate and sometimes furcate trichomes on the new growth, and in the attenuate leaf bases. The flowers of S. triunfense are stellate, as opposed to the rotate to pentagonal flowers of S. wendlandii. Plants of S. wendlandii collected at very early anthesis could be mistaken for S. triunfense, but lack the pubescence on the new growth that is characteristic of S. triunfense.
"
wfo-0001028885,"Solanum kulliwaita is most similar morphologically to S. sanchez-vegae from northern Peru. It can be distinguished from that species by its leaves that are glabrous beneath and with a dense covering of uniseriate trichomes on the adaxial surface of the petiole, the ciliate lower leaf margins and the distinctive uniseriate glandular trichomes of the inflorescence. The inflorescence trichomes are unusual in the Dulcamaroid clade in having three globular cells at the apex and in drying purple (and being purple in live plants, fide Valenzuela et al. 3163). Trichomes of the rest of the plant (i.e., leaves) are not glandular. Specimens from Ecuador have glabrous leaves, but the trichomes of the inflorescence are identical to those found in Peruvian populations.
"
wfo-0001029065,"Solanum leucopogon is most commonly collected in the eastern Andean foothills and adjacent lowlands from northern Ecuador through Peru. The cauline hairs of S. leucopogon make it among the most recognizable species in sect. Micracantha. The stems are typically densely pubescent with red, stellate hairs that have a short stalk (nearly sessile to 0.5 mm in length) but a greatly elongated midpoint (1-5 (8) mm in length). This species is sympatric through much of its range with S. pedemontanum; however, the latter species does not have the conspicuous cauline hairs and is recognizable by a dense white tomentum, especially on the abaxial leaf surfaces. Solanum monachophyllum is weakly supported as the sister species of S. leucopogon in molecular phylogenetic studies. The range of these species possibly overlaps as both occur sporadically in the Amazon Basin; however, most collections of S. leucopogon are from the eastern foothills of the Andes while S. monachophyllum is more commonly collected in the Guiana Shield. Both species occur in disturbed habitats, however, S. monachophyllum is nearly exclusively found on river banks while S. leucopogon is common in light gaps in forests and roadside habitats. Morphologically S. monachophyllum is has nearly glabrous stems, small fruits, and much thinner corolla lobes and longer, narrower anthers than S. leucopogon. Huber chose the epithet leucopogon from the Greek leuco- meaning white and -pogon meaning beard in reference to the dense white pubescence found on the flower buds.
"
wfo-0001027548,"Solanum dichroandrum is very similar morphologically and probably closely related to a number of other Andean members of the Dulcamaroid clade: S. sanchez-vegae, S. aureum and S. luculentum. It is most similar to S. sanchez-vegae, sharing with that species large flowers and loose dendritic pubescence. The two taxa differ in their seed number (with S. dichroandrum having double the number of seeds), style pubescence (glabrous in S. sanchez-vegae, minutely puberulent in S. dichroandrum), and in flower size, with S. dichroandrum having somewhat smaller flowers. The two taxa are not sympatric, and neither is S. dichroandrum sympatric with S. aureum, from which it differs in having larger flowers, looser leaf and stem pubescence and fewer seeded berries. Solanum dichroandrum is sympatric with S. luculentum, from which it differs in leaf and stem pubescence (S. luculentum is completely glabrous), flower size and sex expression (S. dichroandrum has perfect flowers, whereas S. luculentum is almost certainly dioecious)."
wfo-0001031333,"Solanum sousae is superficially similar to S. pyrifolium of Hispaniola, but differs from that species in its more broadly triangular inflorescence outline, minute calyx lobes without thickened margins, anthers borne on unequal filaments and in its lack of a prominent submarginal leaf vein. The leaf pubescence of the two species is very similar, but S. sousae is in general more densely pubescent on the new growth and abaxial corolla surfaces. Solanum sousae differs from the more common and sympatric S. dulcamaroides in its white flowers, generally simple pubescence (versus more commonly dendritic in S. dulcamaroides), white rather than purple flowers, and in its anthers that are not markedly thickened and rounded abaxially. It is likely that the juvenile leaves of S. sousae are pinnatifid, as are those of most other species in this group; young foliage is only very rarely collected and is often not associated with the flowering stems with simple leaves.
"
wfo-0001032465,"Solanum viscosissimum is one of the most variable South American members of the Dulcamaroid clade in terms of leaf shape and pubescence. The many synonyms reflect this variation, and three of these were simultaneously published. Leaf shape varies from simple to almost completely pinnate both between plants and within plants. Leaves on the main growing stems tend to be more pinnate, while those of axillary, inflorescence-bearing shoots are usually simple and often have very short petioles so they clasp the stem. Collections with only the tips of shoots (such as Sellow s.n., a syntype of S. amplexicaule) can look radically different to more complete collections made of stems of varying ages. In addition to extreme variation in leaf shape and dissection, plants of S. viscosissimum vary in the degree of pubescence, with plants from the Rio de Janeiro area being almost glabrous and those from the more southerly part of the range (including the type of S. viscosissimum) being more densely pubescent with glandular trichomes. The trichomes of all plants, however, are of the same type - long (to 2 mm), simple and uniseriate, often with a 1-celled glandular tip. Solanum viscosissimum is unusual in Solanum in having the upper surfaces of the leaves consistently more pubescent than the lower surfaces. In southern Brazil S. viscosissimum is apparently shrubby (L.A. Mentz, pers. comm.), while more northerly populations are uniformly vining. Further molecular study at the population level may reveal differences in these two extremes. Solanum viscosissimum could potentially be confused with S. flaccidum and S. laxum, with both of which it grows sympatrically. It differs from S. flaccidum in usually having at least some pinnate leaves, its smaller flowers with equal filaments, and in its pubescence of long glandular rather than shorter, non-glandular trichomes that are denser on the upper than lower leaf surfaces. Solanum viscosissimum is similar to S. laxum in its small, chartaceous leaves that are usually widest in the lower third, but those of S. laxum have short simple trichomes confined to the vein axils or the trichomes are entirely absent, while the trichomes of S. viscosissimum are evenly distributed over the leaf surfaces. Calyx lobes in S. viscosissimum are long triangular, while those of S. laxum are more deltate with a pronounced apical projection."
wfo-0001026754,"Solanum calileguae is a distinctive species with its dense dendritic pubescence and large, white flowers. It has a restricted Andean distribution, and is easily distinguished from other members of the group potentially occurring in the area. It differs from S. uncinellum, which also has dendritic pubescence on the stems and leaves, in its ellipsoid (rather than long pointed) buds, its rotate-stellate rather than deeply stellate flowers and in its anthers borne on equal filaments. Solanum uncinellum, although widespread over most of South America, has not been collected in the Andean foothills of Argentina, where S. calileguae occurs. Solanum calileguae is most similar and perhaps most closely related to S. flaccidum, from which it differs in the dendritic pubescence and anthers borne on equal filaments. Solanum flaccidum occurs in southeastern Brazil, and the two species are unlikely to be found together in the field."
wfo-0001028667,"Solanum inodorum is a striking plant, not easily confused with any other species of Solanum. The yellowish, exfoliating bark and the twining pedicels, coupled with the pseudo-axillary inflorescences (see below) make it easily distinguished from S. flaccidum and S. odoriferum, with which it is broadly sympatric. The specific epithet is a misnomer, as both this species and S. odoriferum have fragrant flowers (Mentz & Oliveira, 2004). The inflorescence of S. inodorum appears to be axillary like the inflorescences of members of section Pteroidea (the Solanum mite group of the Potato clade, see Knapp & Helgason, 1997), but is in fact terminal on a fore-shortened axillary shoot. The leaves of this shoot are vestigial and soon deciduous, but can occasionally be seen in young shoots. This morphology of inflorescences borne terminally on short shoots is found in other members of the Dulcamaroid clade such as S. valdiviense of Chile. "
wfo-0001026352,"The few specimens of Solanum aspersum have usually been annotated as the more common and widely distributed S. aureum, also from Andean Ecuador. Solanum aspersum differs from that species in its simple uniseriate, rather than congested-dendritic, pubescence and in the elongate buds that open to deeply stellate flowers. Specimens of S. aureum from Azuay province in Ecuador have shiny adaxial leaf surfaces like those of S. aspersum, but always have the characteristic golden dendritic pubescence of that species rather than the simple pubescence of S. aspersum. The leaves of S. aspersum are usually more cordate than those of S. aureum, but some populations of S. aureum approach S. aspersum in overall leaf morphology at first glance. Solanum aspersum has a very scattered distribution all along the Andes from northern Colombia to central Ecuador and is likely to be found in more of the intervening parts of the cordilleras, but it is apparently rare and easily overlooked. A single collection from Cajamarca in northern Peru (Diaz et al. 9717, NY) with simple trichomes on the inflorescence and completely glabrous leaves may also be this species; it shares the elongate buds and simple trichomes, but may represent a different taxon.
"
wfo-0001027714,"Solanum dulcamaroides is a beautiful plant, with large, fleshy flowers and bright red fruits. It is one of the larger vining members of the Dulcamaroid clade, often growing well into the canopy of rainforests. Although it in some ways resembles S. dulcamara (as mentioned by Dunal, 1813), it can be easily distinguished from that species by its inflated, globose angular buds (rather than the turbinate buds of S. dulcamara) and the much larger flowers (to 4 cm in diameter). It also is somewhat similar morphologically to S. boldoense of Cuba (see Knapp, 2008 for a discussion of the mix-up associated with these two species in the collections of Sessé and Mociño) and the more widespread and commonly cultivated S. seaforthianum. Solanum dulcamaroides differs from both those species in its distinctive anther morphology, with the abaxial surface thickened so that the thecae are not visible and the anthers appear as small football-shaped structures, and with pores that do not markedly lengthen to slits with age. The filaments of S. dulcamaroides and S. boldoense are equal, while in S. seaforthianum one filament is longer than the rest. Solanum boldoense has the articulation point of the pedicels just below the base of the calyx tube, while the pedicels of both S. dulcamaroides and S. seaforthianum are articulated at the base from a small sleeve. Pinnatifid leaves are rare in flowering or fruiting specimens of S. dulcamaroides (see below) and S. boldoense, while they are common in S. seaforthianum.
Although very few specimens of S. dulcamaroides have pinnatifid leaves, Nee (1993) records that divided leaves are borne on lower parts of the plant, and that plants cultivated from seed first produced profoundly pinnatifid leaves and eventually produced only simple leaves once stems became flowering. This developmental transition from pinnatifid juvenile to simple adult leaves appears to be relatively common in the Dulcamaroid clade (see S. flaccidum), but is often not noticed as herbarium specimens are usually made only from the terminal portions of reproductive stems. From herbarium specimens, it is apparent that leaf size decreases as the stem makes the transition to the inflorescence. Leaf pubescence varies considerably in S. dulcamaroides, as it does in many other members of the group. Some specimens (especially those from the west of Mexico) are densely pubescent, with some of the trichomes furcate or with a few branches, but the majority of the trichomes are simple. Other plants, among them the type of S. megalospermum (Williams et al. 41964), are almost entirely glabrous. Plants from Nicaragua have smaller flowers (to 2.5 cm in diameter) than do plants from Mexico, flowering collections of S. dulcamaroides from Guatemala are a priority to see if this is a simple cline or due rather to environmental differences.
"
wfo-0001025902,"Solanum amygdalifolium occurs over a very broad geographical range in association with fresh (non-brackish) water, and has been characterised as semi-aquatic by some authors (Mentz & Oliveira, 2004). In chaco habitats in Paraguay it always grows in riverside thickets, and forms loose scrambling tangles. With its very large, showy flowers, strongly angled stems and narrow, simple leaves, it is not easily confused with any other species of the Dulcamaroid clade; it is somewhat similar to other Dulcamaroids from southern South America, particularly narrow-leaved specimens of S. flaccidum, but the smaller flowers, more pubescent leaves and unequal filaments of the latter species are distinguishing features. Solanum flaccidum grows in completely different types of habitats than does S. amygdalifolium, so confusion in the field is unlikely. In general, S. amygdalifolium is quite monomorphic vegetatively over its broad range, varying only in degree of pubescence between individuals and somewhat in inflorescence size depending on plant age, but the flowers of plants from the Chaco regions of Argentina and Paraguay are much larger than those of plants from more coastal populations near the mouth of the Río de la Plata in Buenos Aires and adjacent Uruguay. Flower size may also have something to do with water availability, as plants collected from near streams and wet places in the wet season all appear to have larger flowers than those from drier areas. The specimens collected in the foothills of the Andes in the province of Jujuy, Argentina appear to have all been from cultivated plants (Cabrera, 1983). "
wfo-0001029006,"Solanum laxum was long known in cultivation as S. jasminoides, but the former name has priority and is slowly becoming accepted in botanical (see Mentz & Oliveira, 2004) and horticultural circles. The original source of material cultivated in Great Britain was southern Brazil, and in England the plant overwinters well even in very cold winters (hardy to USDA zone 8), where it dies back from frost, but quickly resprouts. In cultivation vines of S. laxum grow very large; a vine growing up the south-facing wall of the Chelsea Physic Garden in London is over 10 cm in diameter at the base. Solanum laxum is similar, and probably closely related, to the sympatric S. viscosissimum with which it shares rotate-stellate corollas, pubescent styles and purplish black berries. It differs from that species in its almost always simple leaves and in the tufts of trichomes in the vein axils of the leaf undersurfaces; S. viscosissimum usually has at least some deeply pinnatifid leaves and has long, glandular trichomes evenly spread over the leaf surfaces. Flowers of S. laxum are usually white, but can have a purplish tinge, especially when growing in strong light. Solanum laxum could also potentially be confused with S. flaccidum, also sympatric, which differs in its larger purple or violet flowers with anthers borne on unequal filaments and in its more evenly distributed pubescence on leaf surfaces and stems. A few collections (e.g., Stuckert 11592, G) have deeply pinnatifid leaves, but can be distinguished from other similar species such as S. seaforthianum (also common in cultivation) by the conspicuous tufts of trichomes in the vein axils on the leaf undersides. These piinatifid leaves are probably juvenile, and are very occasionally found on stems mixed with simple leaves (e.g., Osten 8265) as is common in other species of the Dulcamaroid clade. Although the tufts of trichomes in the vein axils of the leaf undersides are a good diagnostic character for S. laxum, some populations and individuals appear to lack pubescence of any sort. Similar variation in trichomes is common in the Dulcamaroid clade, and in many other non-spiny solanums. "
wfo-0001022277,"Lycianthes chiapensis var. chiapensis is an upper elevation wet forest species that is localized in the southern tip of Chiapas and the western region of Guatemala along the Pacific slope. Unlike the more common variety, L. chiapensis var. sparsistellata Standl. & Steyerm., this variety is under-collected, and little is known about its appearance and growth form; it is likely a large liana like var. sparsistellata. The lower sympodial units merge into sinuate woody branches as the plant ages. The mature wood is dark brown and lustrous. This variety differs from var. sparsistellata in having a larger flowering calyx that remains campanulate in fruit and adheres to the fruit as it ages; var. sparsistellata has a much smaller calyx that becomes plate-like in fruit. The fruit of var. chiapensis is also larger, ovoid, and has more seeds. This form was the first form to be described, and the type specimens mainly have buds on them, but the larger size of the buds are obvious and different from those of var. sparsistellata. In addition, the leaves of var. chiapensis are somewhat thicker in texture and often more glabrous than those of var. sparsistellata. Although most authors of floras have synonymized the two varieties (for example: Nee, 1986; Gentry & Standley, 1974), they appear to be very different with regard to calyx morphology and fruit size, and so we are keeping them separate in this treatment. Standley and Steyermark introduced confusion into the description of the two varieties when describing var. sparsistellata for the first time (Standl. & Steyerm., 1940). The type of var. sparsistellata is clearly that of the small calyx form, but then one of the paratypes cited (Purpus 7166 from Cerro del Boqueron, Chiapas) is clearly the large calyx form. In describing var. sparsistellata, the authors chose to emphasize pubescence density and ignored the differences in calyx and fruit size.

wfo-0001030053,"Solanum odoriferum is a striking plant, with its large, multi-flowered inflorescences of aromatic flowers. It is superficially similar to the sympatric S. flaccidum but is easily distinguished from that species by its coriaceous, shiny, glabrous leaves, truncate calyx and anthers on filaments of equal length. "
wfo-0001027961,"Solanum flaccidum is a relatively common species where it occurs, and in Brazil it occurs sympatrically with S. odoriferum, also a vining member of the Dulcamaroid clade. The two species can be distinguished by their leaf morphology (glabrous and shining in S. odoriferum, variously pubescent in S. flaccidum), calyx shape (truncate in S. odoriferum, lobed in S. flaccidum) and anther morphology. Solanum flaccidum has one anther with the filament much longer than the other four, while in S. odoriferum, the filaments are all equal throughout anthesis. In early anthesis in S. flaccidum, the filaments appear to be more or less equal, so care must be taken to examine fully mature flowers. In Paraguay S. flaccidum is sympatric with S. uncinellum, which also has one anther borne on a longer filament. Solanum flaccidum has more rotate flowers than the latter species, and in general is less pubescent with simple, rather than dendritic, trichomes. The long filament in flowers of S. uncinellum is twice as long as the other filaments, while in S. flaccidum the long filament is less than twice as long as the others. As with many species in this group, S. flaccidum has heteromorphic leaves, with simple and pinnatifid leaves borne on the same stems. Once a stem is flowering, it appears that the leaves are all simple, so very few collections have been made of plants with pinnatifid leaves. It may be, as with other species of this clade, that juvenile foliage is more likely to be pinnatifid than is foliage on reproductive shoots (see S. dulcamaroides)."
wfo-0001026407,"Solanum aureum is widespread in Ecuador and has been considered to include several species here recognised as distinct: S. sanchez-vegae of northern Peru, S. dichroandrum of northern Colombia and Venezuela and S. aspersum of Ecuador and Colombia, with which S. aureum is sympatric. It is also similar to and often confused with S. cutervanum (see Knapp, 1989). Solanum aureum is almost always described as a vine, but occasionally as shrubby, a habit variously common in the Dulcamaroid clade. Solanum sanchez-vegae and S. dichroandrum differ from S. aureum in their looser, less dense leaf pubescence and somewhat larger flowers. All three taxa have dark purplish black berries, but those of S. aureum are somewhat smaller. Solanum aureum and S. sanchez-vegae may overlap in distribution in northern Peru in the Huancabamba depression; S. dichroandrum is only known Colombia and Venezuela. Specimens now recognised as Solanum aspersum had long been considered as conspecific with S. aureum, but differ from it in their simple trichomes from bullate bases, elliptic buds and flowers with more lanceolate corolla lobes. These two species are sympatric in northern Ecuador. Solanum cutervanum is also sympatric with S. aureum through much of its range and is easily confused with it. The most obvious difference in the two taxa is habit, with S. aureum being a vine and S. cutervanum a shrub, but also the leaf and stem trichomes of S. cutervanum are beige, more elongate and the branches shorter than those of S. aureum, in which the trichomes are golden and dendritic. In Prov. Azuay, Ecuador, S. aureum has markedly shiny upper leaf surfaces and is superficially very like S. aspersum, but the trichomes from these plants are always dendritic with short branches and the flowers with deltate corolla lobes."
wfo-0001029156,"Solanum luculentum was identified as a new species by the Solanaceae specialist Conrad V. Morton in the 1940s on herbarium annotation slips on specimens in US (Archer 1153, 1227), but the name was never published. I decided to use it for this species, as it perfectly describes the distinguishing characteristic of this species: its coriaceous, lustrous and shining leaves. It has long been confused with S. dichroandrum, another vining species from northern South America, but differs from that in its completely glabrous leaves and inflorescences, revolute leaf margins and heterostylous flowers. Solanum luculentum is almost certainly another dioecious species of Solanum, the first reported for the Dulcamaroid clade (see Knapp et al., 1998). Individual specimens either have long-styled flowers and fruit or short-styled flowers, but the breeding system of this interesting species needs to be examined in the field for confirmation. The type specimen is of what I would identify as a male plant, with all short-styled flowers. Albert de Escobar et al. 7939 (HUA) and Steyermark et al. 127855 (MO) are both clearly female plants, with long-styled flowers and fruits on the same stems. Solanum luculentum is apparently very common in Antioquia, and grows in a number of protected areas. Like most other members of the Dulcamaroid clade, S. luculentum has simple adult leaves. A specimen seen by M. Nee (pers. comm.) in HUA (David & Idarraga 373) is said to be of a sterile juvenile with pinnatifid leaves with twining petioles; S. luculentum is the only species of this group occurring in the Reserva Natural Montevivo near Medellín, so it is likely that this specimen indeed is a juvenile of S. luculentum and show that this species too has pinnatifid juvenile leaf morphology."
wfo-0001031144,"Solanum seaforthianum is most similar to the Mexican and Central American S. dulcamaroides, with which it shares large inflorescences, globose, slightly inflated buds, and flowers with fleshy, keeled lobes. It is easily distinguished from that species in its mostly pinnate leaves (rather than mostly simple on flowering stems) that are almost completely glabrous, and its unequal filaments. The anthers of S. dulcamaroides are unusual in that they have a thick, papillate abaxial surface, not present in S. seaforthianum. The anthers borne on unequal filaments of S. seaforthianum are shared with the somewhat similar S. flaccidum of southern Brazil and the widespread S. uncinellum. Solanum seaforthianum can be easily distinguished from S. uncinellum by its glabrous pinnate leaves, ellipsoid (rather than elongate and pointed) buds, ellipsoid rather than tapering anthers, and its broader corolla lobes. It differs from S. flaccidum in its bright red (rather than purple) berries and the glabrous, mostly pinnate or pinnatifid leaves. The native distributions of these taxa do not overlap, but as S. seaforthianum is often cultivated, it can be found in a variety of regions. The leaves of S. seaforthianum are most usually pinnate or pinnatifid and only rarely simple, the reverse of the case in many other species of the Dulcamaroid clade, except S. angustifidum. Solanum seaforthianum differs from S. angustifidum in having broad, rather than narrow, leaf lobes and glabrous filaments. In other taxa juvenile leaves are pinnate (see S. dulcamaroides), so it may be that the pinnate leaves of S. seaforthianum that persist on mature stems are neotenic in nature. The mechanism by which leaf shape is regulated in this group, however, has not been investigated. Solanum seaforthianum is widely cultivated in tropical areas for its showy flowers in large inflorescences, as is S. laxum from southern South America. The two taxa are easily distinguished by leaf shape (pinnate versus simple), pubescence (glabrous versus pubescent with tufts of trichomes in the vein axils) and berry color (red versus purple). The corollas of S. seaforthianum are more deeply divided than those of S. laxum, and are usually purple rather than white in cultivation. Solanum seaforthianum appears to have escaped from cultivation in both Australia and South Africa, but the extent of its spread is not clear at present. "
wfo-0001026604,"Solanum boldoense is very similar to, and has been confused with (see below), S. dulcamaroides of Mexico. The pedicel articulation point serves to easily distinguish the two species: in S. boldoense it is the distal quarter of the length and long pegs are left when flowers fall, while in S. dulcamaroides the pedicel articulates at or very near the base."
wfo-0001029437,"Solanum megalonyx as delimited here can be recognised by its shrubby habit, strongly armed stems and trunk, few-flowered inflorescences, deeply lobed calyx and violet corolla to 3.5 cm in diameter. Pubescence and leaf shape are both highly variable, and a grade exists from the coast inland going from the littoral to the caatinga. Specimens collected in coastal habitats (e.g., Martius s.n., Scardino et al. 305, Noblick 1925) have larger corollas with longer lobes, larger subrhomboid to ovate-lanceolate leaves with the upper surfaces subscabrous and glabrescent, and trichomes with very short rays ca. 1/6 the length of the midpoint. More inland specimens (e.g., Carvalho & Thomas 3103, Carvalho & Plowman 1530, Queiroz & Fraga 3295, Arbo et al. 767, Chautems et al. 148) have more variable pubescence and leaf shape. The leaves are smaller than those from coastal populations, with less lobed and angulate margins, the pubescence is densely villous or tomentose with glandular stellate to multangulate trichomes with a shorter 1-2-celled midpoint. In some collections (e.g., Mori et al. 11111) entire and lobed leaf margins are found on the same plant. The other end of the extreme occurs in plants from the caatingas, which have smaller corollas with narrower lobes (e.g., Agra & Giulietti 5177, Arbo et al 7444), elliptic to ovate-elliptic leaves with velutinous and rusty pubescence of glandular porrect stellate trichomes with a midpoint the same length as the lateral rays. Looking at the extremes of this variation might lead one to think they were different taxa, but the variation is continuous and many intermediates exist. Solanum megalonyx resembles S. cordifolium and S. jabrense, with which it shares simple inflorescences with large (ca. 3 cm diameter) purple flowers. Solanum cordifolium has more strongly cordate leaf bases and lobed glandular leaf margins, viscid pubescence of mixed simple and porrect stellate trichomes with glandular tips, larger, longer corolla lobes, and smaller seeds (2-3 mm in diameter). Solanum jabrense has acicular yellowish golden prickles on the leaves of adult plants, scabrous to tomentose pubescence that leaves the lamina visible, smaller flowers (ca. 2.5 cm in diameter), and is a plant of the high elevation brejo habitat. Two sheets of Pohl 3224, the type collection of S. subcordatum, are present at W. The sheet chosen as the lectotype by Agra (2004) is more complete, with flowers and fruit, and is represented in many herbaria with copies of F negative 33114."
wfo-0001027236,"As delimited here, Solanum cordifolium is one of the most distinctive species of section Erythrotrichum. The cordiforme to ovate-cordate leaves with angulate margins and glandular lobe tips, cordate to subsagittate leaf base, rusty to brown patent or somewhat appressed villous pubescence of glandular stellate trichomes with a midpoint of more than 5 cells and reduced rays, and corolla lobed only to the middle rather than nearly to the base are all distinguishing features of this species. Solanum cordifolium is one of the few species in the group that retains juvenile leaf morphology in adult plants with lobed-angulate leaf margins present at all reproductive stages. Solanum cordifolium is similar to S. megalonyx and S. jabrense, and can be distinguished from the former by its glandular leaf lobe apices, cordate (rather than acute) leaf base and villous (rather than scabrous or tomentose) pubescence. It differs from S. jabrense in its without prickles leaves in adult plants without glandular lobe tips, porrect stellate rather than multangulate trichomes, lanceolate (rather than linear) calyx lobes and larger corolla divided only to the middle (rather than nearly to the base). The majority of specimens in Brazilian herbaria of this species were previously determined as Solanum curvispinum, a species also described from southeastern Brazil. The holotype of S. curvispinum (Gaudichaud 426, G), however, is not a member of section Erythrotrichum as delimited by Agra (2004). Instead, it is a liana, with ovate or ovate-rounded entire leaves, golden to yellow pubescence of minute porrect stellate trichomes with reduced midpoints, globose flower buds, a tubular calyx, a berry > 2.5 cm in diameter with deciduous, simple, eglandular trichomes. It appears to be a member of section Micracantha (the Solanum lanceifolium group of Whalen, 1984). Solanum cordifolium was not included in section Erythrotrichum by Whalen (1984), Child (1998) or Nee (1999), probably due to the lack of correctly determined material of this species in herbaria."
wfo-0001027850,"Solanum erythrotrichum as delimited here is a plant with loose to scabrous pubescence of sessile or subsessile porrect stellate trichomes on stems, upper leaf surfaces, inflorescence axes, pedicels and calyces. The leaves are obovate to ovate-lanceolate, with the upper surfaces scabrous to tomentose with a mixture of porrect stellate and simple glandular trichomes. The inflorescences are monochasial cymes, with flowers that are usually purple or blue, but occasionally white (Calderón 432 from the Mexican state of Oaxaca). The calyx lobes are triangular lanceolate and not very expanded in fruit. The hirsute ovary and berry bear a mixture of simple and stellate trichomes, the stellate trichomes are sessile; in young fruit these have a multicellular midpoint, and in mature fruit a unicellular midpoint. Many specimens of Solanum erythrotrichum have been identified as S. accrescens, another Central American species in this group. The two species can easily be distinguished by size (S. accrescens has larger leaves, calyces, corollas and anthers) and by the pubescence of berries which is simple and glandular in S. accrescens and stellate in S. erythrotrichum. Specimens of S. erythrotrichum from Guatemala and Belize are vegetatively rather homogenous with oblong leaves and trichomes with midpoints to 2.5 mm long on the stems leaf upper surfaces and berries, but flower colour appears to vary from purple to white. Material from Honduras has more elliptic leaves, with trichome midpoints only 1.5 mm long, and narrower calyx lobes. The type of Solanum aripoense (Baker s.n.) matches material of S. erythrotrichum in all but the short, reduced midpoints of the stem trichomes, which only have 1-2-celled midpoints rather than multicellular, flexuous midpoints found in Central American specimens. Although I have only seen one other specimen from northern South America (Philippe et al. 21321, MO, from the Venezuelan state of Trujillo), it is likely to occur more commonly in the region. Benítez de Rojas & Medina (2001) cite additional material of S. erythrotrichum from Venezuela, but I have not seen the specimens they cite."
wfo-0001032303,"Solanum velutinum as here delimited is highly variable and has great plasticity in leaf morphology; leaves can be entire, ovate, ovate-lanceolate (Herrera 146), ovate-elliptic (Davidse et al. 17892, McDowell et al. 2055) or cordate (Ule 9763, Prevost 528, Hahn 5760). Pubescence varies from tomentose to velutinous or woolly, and the upper surfaces have sessile porrect stellate trichomes that are glandular or eglandular. The calyx lobes are equal or unequal in size and distinctly foliaceous, and the corolla varies from purple to white. The entire plant is viscid pubescent from the presence of simple glandular trichomes mixed with sessile glandular porrect stellate trichomes. Specimens from the Guianas are relatively homogenous, with oblong leaves with a rounded base and acuminate apex and with rusty pubescence of sessile porrect trichomes with a glandular midpoint. In Venezuela, plants are more variable, some leaves are small (3.5-6 x 3-4 cm) with an apiculate apex (Holst & Blake 736), while others are broadly ovate-lanceolate. Other Venezuelan specimens are densely and loosely pubescent with midpoints to 2.5 mm and sinuate-angulate margins and prickles on the leaves. Most specimens from Costa Rica have large leaves with a rounded base and acuminate apex. The pubescence of these plants is brighter reddish brown, like that of plants from northern Brazil, and is of porrect stellate trichomes with shorter midpoints that are not glandular. "
wfo-0001027437,"Solanum decorum as recognised here is a relatively uniform species, especially with respect to the pubescence of the entire plant, leaf shape and inflorescence morphology. The leaves are elliptic, lanceolate or oblanceolate, strongly rugose above with a mixture of sessile to subsessile stellate trichomes with a reduced midpoint and scattered stalked glandular trichomes. The pubescence has a strong reddish tinge, especially on the stems, petioles, venation, peduncle and pedicels. The inflorescences are complex and branched, with more than 30 flowers. Solanum decorum is morphologically similar to S. rubiginosum of northern South America, sharing with this species elliptic to lance-elliptic leaves and long-pedunculate inflorescences with more than 30 flowers. It differs from S. rubiginosum in its shrubby habit, its smaller, white flowers, more floccose pubescence composed of stipitate stellate trichomes with a reduced unicellular midpoint, 3-nerved corolla lobes and larger (5-6 mm vs. 3-4 mm) seeds. The leaves of Solanum decorum can vary considerably in shape and pubescence depending upon the age and growing condition of the plant. Juvenile plants tend to have larger leaves with acute or obtuse apices, while pubescence density and type can vary depending upon whether the plants are growing in sun or shade. Plants growing in full sun tend to have denser and redder stellate pubescence than plants in the shade. "
wfo-0001031707,"Solanum ternatum can be a very large woody liana with lower stems up to 2-3 cm in diameter. In cross-section these woody stems are in the shape of the number ‘8’. Like many members of section Pteroidea, considerable variation in pubescence exists within the species, with densely pubescent specimens having been described as S. dendrophilum. The degree of fleshiness of leaves of S. ternatum has also led to the description of many synonyms, but this character is unrelated to geography or habitat, and seems to vary at random throughout the species range. Polymorphism in flower colour is common throughout the species range as well, and unlike members of the Solanum mite species group, purple flower colour does not co-occur with purple leaf undersides (see discussion of Solanum anceps and S. savanillense). "
wfo-0001027092,"The central Texas plants of Solanum citrullifolium var. citrullifolium are somwehat different from those of W texas and Coahuila state, Mexico. The most distal leaf lobes are usually more rounded, the stellae are often absent from the leaf undersides and the inflorescences longer in fruitng stages. The type material of Solanum citrullifolium, grown from seeds in Freiburg, Germany, was of this central Texas form, which now seems to be very scarce. It has only been collected twice since 1930, and the last time in 1949."
wfo-0001028878,"Solanum citrullifolium var. knoblochii most resembles the typical variety (var. citrullifolium), from which is widely disjunct."
wfo-0001026889,"Two varieties of Solanum carolinense are recognised, distinguised in the following key:
1a. Leaf margins subentire, sinuate, or lobed; sinuses of lobes, when present, reaching less than half the distance to the midvein; apex of leaf lobes subacute to acute, sometimes rounded -> Solanum carolinense var. carolinense 1b. Leaf margins deeply lobed to parted; sinuses of lobes reaching more than half the distance to the midvein or almost to the midvein; apex of leaf lobes typically rounded -> Solanum carolinense var. floridanum"
wfo-0001027240,"Solanum coriaceum is similar to species of the Micracantha group (e.g., S. lanceifolium Jacq.) but differs in its almost glabrous, coriaceous leaves and flowers with interpetalar tissue. It is a member of the Crinitum clade (incl. S. crinitum Lam.)."""
wfo-0001021021,"Chamaesaracha coniodes is the most variable species of the genus, exhibiting essentially all forms of pubescence and a variety of leaf shapes. It also varies from robust plants to those relatively small in stature and occurs in a variety of habitats. Unfortunately, the type has a dense covering of dendritic hairs (as also noted by Averett, 2010b), atypical, but not unknown in the species, especially as it occurs to the north and west of the Edwards Plateau of Texas; otherwise it is comparable to C. coniodes. Henrickson (2009) recognized the more southern and southwestern elements as a new species, C. texensis. However, the leaves of the type of C. coronopus are 4-6 times as long as wide (as they typically are in C. arida) and essentially glabrous as are most of the populations in south Texas; those of C. coniodes are densely pubescent; hairs on the type of the latter are dense and are described as stellate but might best be described as short-dendritic or branching; further, the leaves of the type are ca 2.5 times as long as wide, and lack the deep lobed margins found in C. coronopus. In short, the types of C. coronopus and C. coniodes differ in leaf shape and pubecence, but share yet other features."
wfo-0001021023,"My concept of C. coronopus includes those specimens of Chamaesaracha having a predom-inantly small habit, narrow leaves that are typically 4-6 times as long as wide, more deeply and regularly lobed than those of C. arida, and a pubescence of mostly slender branched hairs. In Dunal's original description the type is said to have glabrous or glabrate stems and sub-glabrous peduncles, but he notes the calyx to be pilose. Branched hairs are not mentioned in Dunal's prologue. It should be noted that Henrickson, early on, (by annotation at LL_TEX) treated C. coronopus as consisting of two intergrading taxa: var. arida and var. coronopus; Averett (1973) treated these as but elements of a widespread variable C. coronopus; Averett (2005) subsequently removed C. darcyi from the complex, a taxon of north-central Texas and Oklahoma, but treated C. arida within his concept of C. coronopus, noting that “I see little justification for the recognition of C. arida as a separate species but, with further analyses, it plausibly might be recognized at the varietal level.” With the exclusion of C. arida (as treated herein) and C. darcyi, C. coronopus is largely restricted to southern Texas and closely adjacent Mexico. In southern Texas the occasional hypothetical hybrid between C. coniodes and C. coronopus may be found, the two taxa being sympatric throughout most of the region."
wfo-0001021025,"The species is very close to C. coniodes, having a dense vestiture of branched, dendritic hairs like those found on the type of C. coniodes. However, C. darcyi typically has more deeply lobed or toothed leaf margins and a nearly prostrate habit. The species is also disjunct from populations in south Texas with a similar vestiture and east of populations with unbranched simple trichomes."
wfo-0001021027,"This species and its estimated parameters as treated by Averett need no revision, except for its exclusion from Mexico, as noted below. It is closely related to C. pallida but can be distinguished from it by having peduncles with predominantly straight glandular hairs (vs. dendritic, eglandular hairs), mostly narrower leaves and by distribution. Occasional plants will display along their peduncles an admixture of both glandular and eglandular dendritic hairs (e.g., Blanco Co., Watson & Averett 179 (TEX); Concho Co., Averett 358, 485 (TEX); Crockett Co., Turner 99-30 (TEX); Kinney Co., Strother 253 (TEX); Menard Co., Turner 21-784 (TEX); Schleicher Co., Turner 98-496 (TEX); Val Verde Co., Webster 32284 (TEX); I have treated these as hypothetical intermediates. As noted in the introduction to this paper, pubescence may be under relatively simple genetic control that might account for the variability in vestiture observed among and between populations of C. coronopus. Alternatively, occasional hybridization between C. edwardsiana and C. coronopus may confound the distinctions between these and C. pallida, the latter possessing a vestiture resembling that of C. coronopus, but having habital features and leaf margins of C. edwardsiana. Vestiture in C. pallida varies in similar fashion to that of C. edwardsiana, occasional plants of the former will have peduncles mostly without glandular hairs; nevertheless occasionally populations of C. pallida (e.g., Brewster Co., Warnock T283, TEX) will have plants with glandular peduncles, approaching those of C. edwardsiana, but otherwise typical. Finally, it should be noted that Averett, with his original description, maps ten or more collections of C. edwardsiana as occurring in the states of Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, Mexico; I take nearly all such collections to be specimens of C. pallida, and these will key as such in the present treatment."
wfo-0001021035,"This species is very closely related to C. edwardsiana, and might be treated under the latter as but varietally distinct (as sheets so annotated by Henrickson at TEX). I believe, however, the two are distinct, their differences equal to those separating other species within Chamaesaracha. The characters used in the key to distinguish between these suggest that typical C. edwardsiana is confined to the Edwards Plateau region of central Texas, while C. pallida is largely confined to the Trans-Pecos, Texas, New Mexico, and north-central Mexico. Averett (1973) used leaf shape and pubescence to distinguish between the two taxa; however, leaf shape and pubescence is very variable in this alliance and reliance upon such characters probably accounts for the overlapping distribution of these two taxa as depicted in Averett's Fig. 6. It is likely that additional collecting in the easternmost part of the distribution of C. pallida will show that intergrades commonly occur between the two. Early on, I tentatively identified several likely intermediates between these as occurring in Sterling Co., Texas (Averett 309, TEX) and Irion Co. (Warnock 7700, TEX) counties, the plants concerned having nearly entire leaves and a peduncular pubescence like that of C. pallida; such plants were subsequently accepted as belonging to the latter, having most of its characters, except for leaf shape. Indeed, nearly entire leaves occur sporadically in most species of Chamaesaracha, and reliance upon this character alone is likely to result in the occasional misidentification. Variation in C. pallida is undoubtedly confounded by the occasional hybridization between this and C. sordida, as attested to by three specimens assembled on the same sheet (Brewster Co., Glass Mts., Warnock 21201, TEX): one of these C. sordida, the other two hypothetical hybrids or backcrosses with C. pallida (Averett, however, annotated the three specimens as distinct species: C. coniodes, C. pallida and C. sordida)."
wfo-0001021040,"This is a very distinct species of Chamaesaracha, what with its creeping habit and markedly fractiflex stems. There is little material of this species in herbaria and its relationship to other species of Chamaesaracha seems obscure. It differs in habit and basic leaf morphology from yet other species of the genus and its range represents a significant disjunction from other elements of the genus."
wfo-0001021042,"My concept of C. sordida is about the same as that of Averett (1973), and this need not be described anew. The species is partially sympatric with C. conoides, C. darcyii, C. arida, and C. coronopus and is readily distinguished from these and others by its rather uniform array of short glandular trichomes, the latter always predominating over any display of branched hairs. Branched hairs, however, are not uncommonly found in C. sordida, a smidgen of which intermixed with a much more numerous display of glandular hairs occasional occur in this or that population of yet other taxa. It is possible that such admixtures are due to the occasional hybridization of C. sordida with one or more of the other species, but the great mass of the specimens, as shown in Map 6, possess mostly short glandular hairs, but eglandular trichomes are relatively common. Further evidence of hybridization is suggested by chromosome counts. Averett (1973) noted three widely separated triploid populations with chromosome numbers of n = 18 (all other counts are n = 12) which probably result from crosses with tetraploid (n = 24) populations. There was, however, no morphological evidence that another taxon had contributed to these hybrids."
wfo-0001343299,"Jaltomata neei grows in Peru, Department Cajamarca, Province San Miguel, between 2400 and 2920 m in the native vegetation along roadsides. The flowers are protogynous. Younger flowers have a green corolla and are pistillate: they are fully open but anthers have
not yet dehisced. Older flowers have a blueish corolla and dehisced anthers, and thus are functionally hermaphroditic. The dehiscence of the anthers and the corolla color change from green to blue are not always synchronous; some flowers in the field had both a bluish corolla and anthers that had not yet dehisced. Red nectar is produced by flowers in both the pistillate and hermaphroditic phases. In the phylogeny of Miller et al. (2011) this species was referred to as J. “rednectar.”"
wfo-0001343300,"Jaltomata quipuscoae and the other two species of J. section Modillonia (Leiva González et al., 2010) share the following characters: they are endemic to Peru, they are herbaceous and have solitary flowers with a 5-lobed corolla, a corona (a structure on which nectar pools), basifixed anthers (the filament is inserted on the lower ventral face of the anther in other sections of this genus), and a stigma no wider than the top of the style (punctiform, not capitate). They also produce copious red-orange nectar, and the fruits are green to whitish (except for one report of orange fruits in J. aspera)."
wfo-0001031027,"Solanum sanfurgoi was synonymized under Solanum grandidentatum (Knapp et al., 2023). However, S. sanfurgoi differs from S. grandidentatum by having a short, appressed calyx lobes with rounded tips, and a small corolla that is entirely white on both sides, with the adaxial surface sparsely puberulent, as noted by Philippi (1895). The corolla in S. sanfurgoi is small (4-6.5 mm), campanulate, and not reflexed at anthesis, unlike S. grandidentatum, which has large flower (12-15 mm) with a greenish yellow eye, as reported by Knapp et al. (2023). The indumentum in S. sanfurgoi is simple and homogenous, consisting of short (0.2 mm), exclusively non-glandular trichomes distributed across the plant. In contrast, S. grandidentatum is characterised by pubescence with white, glandular, simple trichomes (0.5-1 mm) that are sticky to touch, features not observed in wild S. sanfurgoi. "
wfo-0001027093,"Solanum citrullifolium var. knoblochii most resembles the typical variety (var. citrullifolium), from which is widely disjunct."
wfo-0001023301,"Solanum chmielewskii is sister to S. neorickii and is difficult to distinguish from that species in the absence of flowers. Both species are related to S. arcanum, from northern Peru, rather than to S. lycopersicum and the other red-fruited species, as was suggested by Rick et al. (1976). The flowers of S. chmielewskii are about twice the size of those of S. neorickii, and the stigma is always exerted from the anther cone. The corolla tube tends to be slightly larger in diameter, with a more pentagonal corolla outline. Both species have uniform, short whitish pubescence and small green fruits."
